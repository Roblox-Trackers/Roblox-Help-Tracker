      Memberships purchased through the Roblox mobile app via iTunes, and Google Play are
      <strong>
       recurring by default
      </strong>
      and will renew at the end of their term using theÂ original payment method. You can cancel at any time
      <strong>
       before
      </strong>
      <strong>
       the renewal date
      </strong>
      . If you cancel a recurring subscription, you will continue to receive membership privileges for the remainder of the already paid time. Whereas, memberships purchased through the Roblox mobile app via Windows and Amazon app stores are for a single month.

       Please remember, it is better to cancel sooner rather than later to avoid being charged.
