       Roblox users should always get permission from the payment account owner (their parent, guardian, or adult relative) before making any purchase. Unauthorized charges are a violation of our Terms of Use and may result in the permanent closure of the associated user account(s).
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever possible, we work with parents and customers directly as part of our permissive refund policy to provide a refund for unauthorized purchases. However, some third-party payment processors require refunds to go through their support services and Roblox is unable to refund charges for those providers.
