      If Roblox is currently experiencing an issue or undergoing maintenance, you may experience the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Products for purchases may be delayed in receipt.  Please rest assured that if a product is not immediately applied to your account, it will be soon.  All completed purchases will have the product applied.  In most cases products are applied within the hour and at most within 24 hours.  This may also happen with virtual purchases made onsite or in game with Robux.
      </li>
      <li>
       Joining a game may be delayed or unsuccessful.  If you experience any issue with joining games, please wait for a few moments and try again.
      </li>
      <li>
       You may experience lag or delays while using the website, platform, or applications.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your patience.  Our team is diligently working on updates to ensure that all players can continue to enjoy Roblox.
