      Disable Your Web Browser's Add-Ons
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      Many times website-related problems are the result of third party Add-Ons for your web browser. These may also be referred to as "Extensions" or "Plugins" depending on your browser of choice. To see if this is the case for you, try disabling all of your Add-Ons. If the issue resolves, try re-enabling them one at a time until your issue starts occurring again. Once the problem starts back up, you should have found the one that is incompatible with Roblox.
