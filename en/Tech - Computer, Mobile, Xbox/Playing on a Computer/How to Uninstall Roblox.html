      Delete the Roblox folder

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      If you are having a particularly persistent problem, it may be helpful to fully remove the Roblox folder after uninstalling to make sure there are not any corrupted or outdated files left over. You can do this by following the steps below:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Right click on the start button and click
        <strong>

        </strong>
        or
        <strong>
         File Explorer
        </strong>
       </li>
       <li>
        Navigate to this folder :
        <em>
         C:\Users\(Your Windows Username)\AppData\Local
        </em>
       </li>
       <li>
        Delete the Roblox folder
       </li>
      </ol>
     </ul>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent3">
      <em>
       Note: This should not delete any places that you may have saved in Studio unless you have manually chosen to save them in this folder.

      Difficulty Uninstalling
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      If you are having difficulty uninstalling the program, try the following:
     </p>
     <h3 class="wysiwyg-indent3">
      Clear your Temporary Internet Files
     </h3>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent4">
      An important step in any uninstall or reinstall process is to clear your browser's temporary internet files. This will help with any corruption issues that might have arisen. For assistance with this process, please
      <a href="/hc/articles/204038784" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       click here
      </a>
      and see the
      <strong>
       Clear Your Temporary Internet Files and Cookies
      </strong>
      section.
     </p>
     <h3 class="wysiwyg-indent3">
      Check Your Firewall
     </h3>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent4">
      A lot of antivirus or internet security software tries to control which programs can access the internet. Often, these programs err on the side of caution and by default, no program is allowed access. For assistance with looking into this and allowing Roblox through any blockages,

     <h3 class="wysiwyg-indent3">
      Reinstall Roblox
     </h3>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent4">
      The next possibility is to Reinstall. This may seem counter-intuitive but if the problem is a corrupted file from a previously unsuccessful uninstall attempt, this will overwrite the copy of the program on your computer, and replace any deleted or broken files. You should then be able to go into your Start menu and uninstall the program. For assistance with reinstalling, please
