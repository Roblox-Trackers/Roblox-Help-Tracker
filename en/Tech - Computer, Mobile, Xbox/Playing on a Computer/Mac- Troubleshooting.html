       If you are currently using the Safari web browser and having an issue, try using one of our supported browsers such as Firefox or Google Chrome.
      </li>
      <li>
       Check to make sure that the Roblox icon is currently on your Dock and the Roblox Application is showing in your Applications folder.
      </li>
      <li>
       Try launching the program from the Dock if you're having a problem playing an experience from the website.
      </li>
      <li>
       Try fully resetting your Roblox settings by deleting the settings files. To do this go to Library-&gt;
       <strong>
        Preferences
       </strong>
       and delete all of the Roblox com files. When Studio/Player are launched again, it should reinstall them all.
