      Please try each step below, one at a time, in order. If one solution doesn't work, move on to the next!

     <h2 class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Reboot
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      First reboot your computer and try to play. Sometimes this may be all that is needed to solve Roblox or Roblox Studio related problems.

     <h2 class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Clear your Temporary Internet Files
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      An important step in any uninstall or reinstall process is to clear your browser's temporary internet files. This will help with any corruption issues that might have arisen. For assistance with this process, please

     <h2 class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Check your Firewall
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      A lot of antivirus or internet security software tries to control which programs can access the internet. Often, these programs err on the side of caution and by default no program is allowed access. For assistance with looking into this and allowing Roblox through any blockages,
