      If your anti-virus has flagged Roblox as a concern, please rest assured that Roblox is virus free and does not contain any malware. Occasionally, antivirus programs may flag a program incorrectly, which is known as a false positive. Here are some suggested solutions to help prevent that from happening, as well as what you can do if it occurs:
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h1>
      Update Your Anti-Virus
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Sometimes all that you need to do is just make sure that you have the most recent version of your anti-virus program. It's possible that they have already patched the problem. If this doesn't work, then let's move on to the next possibility.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h1>
      Flag The Report as a False Positive
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If updating the software didn't help, then you'll need to flag the warning as a False Positive. To ensure that the Roblox program is able to run correctly, you will need to set it as a permitted program for any anti-virus or anti-malware application. This can be different for each program, but the below links may be able to help with some of the most common ones.
