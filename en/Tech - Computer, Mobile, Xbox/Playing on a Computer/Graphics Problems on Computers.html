      Detecting your Supported DirectX Feature Level

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      To check your supported DirectX feature level:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Hit
        <strong>
         Windows Key
        </strong>
        +
        <strong>
         R
        </strong>
        to bring up the
        <strong>
         Run
        </strong>
        prompt.
       </li>
       <li>
        Type “dxdiag” (without quotes) and press the
        <strong>
         Enter
        </strong>
        key.
       </li>
       <li>
        Click the
        <strong>
         Display
        </strong>
        or
        <strong>
         Display 1

        , and
        <strong>
         Display 2

        if available, tab from the panel view in the DirectX window.
        <ul>
         <li>
          For Windows 8.1/10 look for
          <strong>
           Feature Levels
          </strong>
          . For Windows 7 look for
          <strong>
           DDI Version
          </strong>
          .
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ol>
     </ol>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      If you do not see “10" or above in the “DDI Version” or “Feature Levels” line, your graphics card does not support DX10 or higher and you will be unable to access the application.

      Lower Your Display's Color Quality
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      It's possible your graphics card can't support 3D rendering at the color quality you use for normal desktop operation. You can try lowering the bit depth to 16 bits, to see if that helps.
