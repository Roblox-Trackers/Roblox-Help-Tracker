      Mac Parental Controls have been known to cause issues with Roblox properly connecting to our servers or interfering with the experience. If you are experiencing these issues or similar, temporarily disable Parental Controls to see if the problems are resolved.

      If Roblox is then able to function correctly, consult

      for information onÂ how to add a program to the Parental Controls' approved list. Third-party parental control programs are also available, should a replacement for Mac controls be desired.
