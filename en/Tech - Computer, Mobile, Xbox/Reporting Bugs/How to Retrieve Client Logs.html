      Roblox and Roblox Studio Logs are both written to the same folder.

      <li>
       On PC, press the WINDOWS KEY and R at the same time. A box called
       <strong>
        Run
       </strong>
       will appear. Copy and paste or type in the following without quotes: "%localappdata%\Roblox\logs"

      <li>
       On Mac, navigate to Macintosh HD &gt; Users &gt; [your user profile] &gt; Library &gt; Logs &gt; Roblox

     </ul>
     <h2>
      There will likely be many log files in this folder
     </h2>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Roblox logs will look like: “0.&lt;major ver&gt;.&lt;minor ver&gt;.&lt;revision&gt;_&lt;date&gt;_Player_&lt;garbage&gt;_last.log
       <ul>

       Roblox Studio logs will look the same except says “Studio” instead of “Player

         For example 0.555.1.5550874_20221214T162601Z_Studio_9aaf3_last.log

       </ul>

      <li>
       Bootstrapper logs will look like bootstrapper_&lt;garbage&gt;_1.txt
       <ul>
        <li>
         Unless the issue is happening when launching Roblox or RobloxStudio from your web browser, or during update, you most likely do not need to send bootstrapper logs.
