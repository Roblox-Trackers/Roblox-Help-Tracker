      Check Your Windows System Clock
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      It may sound strange, but various problems can actually be caused by your Windows system clock being set to the wrong time or date. If this is the cause, simply correcting everything should remedy the situation. While this can be done manually, you can also set it to automatically update with a server, thus making sure it doesn't slip behind and start causing issues again. Here's how to do this:
     </p>
     <h3 class="wysiwyg-indent3">
      Windows 8 or earlier
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Right click on the windows clock in the lower right corner
       </li>
       <li>
        Click
        <strong>
         Adjust Date/Time
        </strong>
       </li>
       <li>
        Select the
        <strong>
         Internet Time
        </strong>
        tab
       </li>
       <li>
        Here you should be able to synchronize your time and date with an internet server
       </li>
