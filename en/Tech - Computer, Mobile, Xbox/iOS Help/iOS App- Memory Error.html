      If a memory error occurs when you try to play an experience through the Roblox Mobile application, you may be running too many applications at the same time. To fix it, you may need to close some programs to allow the experiences to run properly or restart your device. If you share your iDevice with other people, be sure to check with them before closing an application or restarting.
