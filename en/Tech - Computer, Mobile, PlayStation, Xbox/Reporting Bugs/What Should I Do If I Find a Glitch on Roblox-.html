      We're always working hard to make Roblox run smoothly for all our players and developers, but occasionally, glitches do happen. If you find a glitch, make a post on the

       Dev Form following the guidelines

      . If you're not able to post on the Dev Forum, contact us using
      <a href="https://www.roblox.com/support">
       this Form
      </a>
      to let us know by selecting
      <strong>
       Bug Report
      </strong>
      for the
      <strong>
       Type of help category
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Remember to be as detailed as possible and provide information such as: What exactly does the glitch do? When did it start happening? Does it happen in one place or in all places?, etc. This will make it easier for us to track down the issue.
