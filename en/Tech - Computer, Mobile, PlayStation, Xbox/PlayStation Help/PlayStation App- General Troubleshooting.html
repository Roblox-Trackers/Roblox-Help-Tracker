      If you are experiencing issues with the Roblox App on PlayStation, we recommend going through the solutions provided by Sony on their PlayStation Support page:
      <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/games/game-launch-issues/">
       How to troubleshoot issues when starting a game
      </a>
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      <em>
       Note: Keep in mind we recommend these solutions for general issues and not just for situations where the app does not start.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      If after going through the steps listed on that page, the issue(s) persist,
