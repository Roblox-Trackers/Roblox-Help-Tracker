      Can I get free Robux, Memberships, or valuable items?

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      No. Any offer of free Robux, memberships, or valuable items is a scam. These are meant to trickÂ you into giving out your password or personal information, or make you click on a bad link. Their goal is to take your account and all your Robux and items.
