      Can I buy monthly memberships with Credit?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Yes! When choosing a payment method, select
      <strong>
       Roblox Credit
      </strong>
      if you've already redeemed the card. Or, you can select
      <strong>
       Redeem Roblox Card
      </strong>
      if you haven't yet redeemed the card.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Memberships purchased with Roblox Credit will automatically renew unless they are canceled
      <em>
       before
      </em>
      the renewal date. Your available Credit must cover the full price of your purchase at time of renewal.
