      </li>
      <li>
       Fraud prevention measures put in place by your banking institution were triggered.
      </li>
      <li>

      What can I do to prevent this?
     </h2>
     <ul>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Register the correct billing information with the card provider. YouÂ can do this by visiting the card company's website or calling the customer service number on the card.
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       When you make a payment, make sure the billing information you enter on Roblox matches the registration information exactly.

       Try a different payment method.

      A pending charge is showing on my card

      A charge may be showing for two reasons:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       Your financial institution is holding the declined charge in a pending state while the payment resolves. Those funds will return to your card within 1-10 business days.
      </li>
      <li>
       You were charged a small, temporary, verification fee. Those funds will return to your card within 1-10 business days. See
