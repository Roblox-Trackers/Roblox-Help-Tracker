      For security reasons, you may be asked to verify your transaction with our Xsolla payment provider which allows users all over the world to make your payment safe and secure. Card verification is a common practice that helps ensure payment security.
     </p>
     <h1>
      How the verification process works:
     </h1>
     <p>
      Xsolla will create a micro-transaction on your financial account (typically between $0.20 - $0.90 USD). The amount of this micro-transaction is the verification code that you must enter in the form. You only need to enter the numeric value of the charge, so if your code is $0.44, you must enter 0.44 in the form to verify your transaction.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Verification codes are valid for a period of 3 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
       If you receive multiple codes, be sure to use the latest one.
      </li>
      <li>
       If your code expires, a new code will be generated and delivered to you after attempting to make another payment with the same card.
      </li>
     </ul>

      What happens if I don't verify my purchase:
     </h1>
     <p>
      The purchase will be refused and no cost will be charged for the attempted purchase. Note, however, that transactions can trigger a security alert with the financial institution and the funds from the purchase can be held pending, in a "pending" state for a few days. Please note that some banks and credit card companies do not show the difference between "pending" and "published" charges.
     </p>
     <p>
      These pending security charges are not sent to Roblox. Any pending charges must be reversed to your account within 1-10 business days if they haven't already.
     </p>

      What happens to the verification charge:
     </h1>
     <p>
      The amount of the micro-transaction will be automatically credited back to your account within 1-10 working days regardless of whether you complete the purchase or not with Xsolla.
