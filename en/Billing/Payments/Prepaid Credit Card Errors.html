      Invalid Card or Unsuccessful Payment
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The most common cause is the prepaid credit card has not been registered, or the billing information put in at the time of payment does not match the billing details registered with the prepaid credit card.
     </p>
     <h2>
      What can I do to prevent these errors?
     </h2>
     <ul>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Register the correct billing information with the prepaid card provider. You can do this by visiting the card company's website or calling the customer service number on the card.
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       When you make a payment, make sure the billing information you enter on Roblox matches the registration information exactly.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>
      What if the issue is already happening?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If the transaction is not going through, do
      <strong>
       not
      </strong>
      try to re-purchase. This can result in pending charges that can place a hold on the balance of the card for up to 10 days. The amount held will return to your card automatically and Roblox will not receive payment. If you have problems even after registering, call the customer service number on your card to see why they are declining the charges.

       If using a re-loadable card for a recurring membership, make sure to top it up before the renewal date, or cancel the membership before the card runs out of funds.
