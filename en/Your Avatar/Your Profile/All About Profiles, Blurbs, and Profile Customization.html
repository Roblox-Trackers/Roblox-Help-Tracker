      To view your own profile, simply tap your own username on the
      <strong>
       Home

      screen or tap
      <strong>
       Profile

      from the navigation menu. Viewing someone else's profile:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Using the Search Box: You can type the name of the profile you wish to view into the search box at the top of the app.
      </li>
      <li>
       Item or Experience Creators: You can view the profile of an experience or item's creator by going to its details page and tapping on their name. For experiences, this is located beneath the title and for items this is located to the right of its image.
      </li>

     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The first thing you see when viewing a profile is the basic information box. Here you will find the user's player icon, user name, their most recent status update, and interaction options.

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      You can view the items or experiences that a player has created by tapping on the Creations tab of the player profile. This is located beneath the basic information box. This tab will display everything the user has created separated by category.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      By default, the experiences will display in a detailed view that focuses on one experience at a time and can be scrolled through by tapping the arrow icons on the left and right of the description box. You can, however, display multiple experiences at once by tapping on the

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      Occasionally you may find that some of your creations are better examples of your building abilities or personality than others. If this is the case, you can choose to only showcase specific ones. To do this:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       Visit the experience/item's details page
      </li>
      <li>
       Tap the gear-icon or icon that looks like three dots to the right of the title
      </li>
      <li>
       In the menu that pops up tap either
       <strong>
        Add to Profile
       </strong>
       or
       <strong>
        Remove from Profile

      Occasionally users may wish to let people know what they're all about, or maybe they just want to entertain their fellow players with some funny quotes. The blurb, visible in a profile's
      <strong>
       About
