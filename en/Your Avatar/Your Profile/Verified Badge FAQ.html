      About Verified Badge:
     </h1>
     <h2>
      What is a verified badge?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The Verified Badge is a visual indicator that allows users to easily identify notable and authentic creators, developers, groups, and off-platform figures. The badge helps address impersonation on the platform and indicates that Roblox has confirmed the account belongs to the user or group it represents, and they meet our
      <a href="#criteria_table" target="_self">
       criteria
      </a>
      for notability.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h2>
      How can I tell if an account is verified on Roblox?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Roblox is a global community founded on creation and connection! You may notice some of your favorite Roblox users and groups with a blue Roblox checkmark on their profile. This indicates the account belongs to a notable and authentic user or group. You’ll see the Verified Badge next to account names across Avatar Shop, user and group profile pages, item and experience detail pages, as well as in search.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If a profile does not have the badge attached to their display name, but it appears somewhere else, like in their bio or in images, then it's not a verified account. Verified badges can only be granted by Roblox and will appear in the same places every time.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h2>
      Why do we have it?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Roblox’s verified badge is an easy way for users to know they’re interacting with authentic developers, creators, and off-platform figures. This badge provides an important layer of confidence, clarity, and trust for everyone on Roblox.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      As a platform for creators, Roblox wants to help you easily identify and discover notable and authentic profiles with our new Verified Badge. The verified badge is a clear way to tell that the profile belongs to a notable creator, developer, or group and is
      <a href="#authentic" target="_self">
       authentic
      </a>
      rather than an impersonator, duplicate, or fan account.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
     </p>
     <h2>
      Will not having a Verified Badge impact my content and its discoverability?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      No, the Verified Badge will not impact search and recommendations for new or unverified creators.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
     </p>
     <h2>
      Why don’t I see the Verified Badge?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      We are currently running tests on the Verified Badge, so some users may not see it right away!
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
     </p>
     <h2>
      Isn’t there already a badge like this on Talent Hub?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The Verified Badge is different from the ID verification badges on Talent Hub– those badges are only for ID verification, but the Verified Badge (aka Roblox’s blue checkmark) is to distinguish notable and authentic creators on the platform.

      How do I apply for the Verified Badge?

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      At this time, there is no application process– as we roll out this new feature, we're notifying creators who meet the established

     <h2>
      How are verified badges given?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Several factors are considered when granting a verified badge, including whether the account is notable, authentic, and adheres to our
      <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/203313410" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       Community Standards

      .
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      However, a verified badge does not imply an endorsement by Roblox. All users must adhere to our guidelines to ensure that Roblox remains a safe, civil, and fun platform for everyone–verified users are no exception!

We also reserve the right to revoke the badge if a recipient repeatedly violates our standards and terms, which include intellectual property infringement. If you try to sell or spoof the badge, this will also make you ineligible and remove the badge from your account.

      Additionally, if you make changes to your account that impact our authenticity verification, you can lose the badge. Account changes that disable the badge are: removing 2-step verification by Authenticator App, removing ID verification, changing your username or display name, changing the group’s name, or changing the group’s owner.
