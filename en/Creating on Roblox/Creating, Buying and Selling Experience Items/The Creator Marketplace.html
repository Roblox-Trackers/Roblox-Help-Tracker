      The Creator Marketplace, formerly called the Library, is a collection of freely available models, decals, audio, videos, meshes, and plugins that you can use to help create the experience of your dreams! Keep in mind that unlike clothing and gear, Creator Marketplace items will not be able to be worn on your avatar.
