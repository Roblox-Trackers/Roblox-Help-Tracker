      Once you have created the experience, group or piece of clothing of your dreams, it's time to get the word out so that other players can start enjoying the fruit of your labors. While word of mouth is a powerful tool on its own, Roblox offers several tools to help get you started. One of these tools is the User Ads feature.

      What are user ads?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Ads are images that players upload that can be use to promote their places, clothing, models, decals, groups, etc. These will be displayed at the top and sides of Roblox.com. When the image is clicked, it will take you to the thing that is being advertised.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Advertising is a good way to bring attention to the awesome stuff that you have built or made. You may even be able to make Robux by bidding on ads for an item which other players may then purchase or visit.
