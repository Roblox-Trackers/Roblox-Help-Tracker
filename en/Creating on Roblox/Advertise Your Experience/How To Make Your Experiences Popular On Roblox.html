      page has an icon that represents it to the community. This is your chance to make a first impression, so choose a picture that’s colorful, well-framed, and aesthetically pleasing. For assistance in creating your place's icon as well as tips on what to do or avoid, please

      Add Awesome and Informative Images and Videos to Your Place
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      While your icon and title can lead to your first clicks, the gallery will help them decide to press Play. While a nicely framed standard thumbnail might be enough, you can also add images you have created with your favorite image editor or a YouTube video to help really sell it.

     <h2>
      Make an Experience That Keeps ‘Em Coming Back
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Make as many badges and achievements as you can for your place, and make sure the top ones are difficult, or nearly impossible, to earn. A lot of Roblox users are hard-core gamers, and they don’t think they've beaten the experience until every achievement is completed and every trophy is obtained. Make ‘em work for it. You can also incentivize repeat visits by utilizing our

     <h2>
      Advertise Your Experience
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Advertising your experience on Roblox is a great way to get noticed and an awesome creative outlet. Roblox's two ad systems, User Ads and Sponsored Experiences, are fantastic ways to get your experience seen by people that might otherwise have missed it. There are a limited number of ad slots, so they work on a bidding system—the more Robux you choose to spend on your promotion, the more frequently it’ll pop up on Roblox.com while users are browsing. But bidding is only half of the art—make creative, colorful ads that will draw people’s attention. For a more in-depth look at these systems, please see the following links:

      Don’t be discouraged, as a lot of factors are at play that will determine the success of your experience. If something doesn’t work, try again. And again. Part of the joy of our platform is that you can build to your heart’s content. Keep at it, and keep trying new things!
