       Roblox has signed a license agreement with APM Music that will provide our users with access to hundreds of thousands of tracks ("Licensed Music") for inclusion in their games on Roblox. Even better, all of this Licensed Music is royalty free for use on the Roblox platform! We have taken care of the licensing for you so you don’t have to worry about synchronization, master use, mechanical, and performance licenses. And you can use all of the Licensed Music starting today!

        You can use up to 250 licensed tracks at a time in a single game on Roblox as part of the service. This limit includes tracks used in boom boxes in your game.

        In addition to using these tracks as-is from the Toolbox, you can use the Studio sound properties to create derivative works of the Licensed Tracks solely within your game on Roblox. You can find more information about these properties on the

      Removal and Blocking of Copyrighted Music
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       Starting on June 18th, 2018, we will be removing certain copyrighted music that is currently on Roblox that is not part of the approved Licensed Music. As a reminder, it is against the Roblox

       to upload music unless you own it or it is properly licensed. If you don’t remove any copyrighted music, and it is flagged by our Moderation team, we will automatically replace the music with Licensed Music. Your account will not receive moderation, but any music that is replaced as part of this process will not receive a refund.

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       We will also be blocking any future use of certain copyrighted music. Any attempts to upload non-Licensed music

       , please check that all music in your games is owned by you or is properly licensed. If you do not own or have a license to the music in your game (or if you are not sure), you should replace it immediately. You can replace the music in your game with one of the newly licensed tracks mentioned above, with original music, or with music for which you are certain you possess all necessary rights.
