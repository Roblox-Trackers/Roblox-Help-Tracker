      Edit Mode is a feature in Roblox Studio that allows you to edit all or most parts of a place, without anything moving (sort of
      <em>
       like time has stopped
      </em>
      ). It offers a large amount of tools and options to help you build and customize your place. Before you exit Edit Mode it is recommended that you save what you were working on to your computer.

     <ul>
      <li>
       By visiting an experience's details page, clicking on the icon that looks like three dots above the play button and selecting
       <strong>
        Edit
       </strong>
       from the menu that pops up. Please note that this will need to be one of your own experiences or if it belongs to someone else, it will need to not be

       .

       <strong>
        Edit
       </strong>
       button.
      </li>
      <li>
       By opening a place that is saved to your computer by choosing
       <strong>
        Open
       </strong>
       in Studio's File menu.
      </li>
      <li>
       By Selecting File &gt;
       <strong>
        New

       in Studio. This opens a blank place that can be turned into nearly anything you want.

      The Tabs
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Studio offers a variety of different options in quick clickable buttons located within various tabs. These tabs are:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Home
       </strong>
       : This contains a variety of the most commonly used buttons for quick reference.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Model
       </strong>

      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Terrain
       </strong>
       : This has all of the tools that allow you to modify the terrain.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Test
       </strong>
       : All of the things you need to help you test how your changes will work inside of the experience are located here. Additionally, the Emulation area of this tab will let you see how your experience might look on one of several mobile devices or TVs.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        View

     <h1>
      The Explorer and Properties Sections
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Once you're in Edit Mode (
      <em>
       either in a new place, or an already built one
      </em>
      ) you will see two sections labeled Explorer and Properties on the right of the screen. If you do not see one or both of them, you can reopen them by clicking the corresponding icons in the View tab.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Explorer
        <br/>
       </strong>
       This section will list everything that is located inside of your place. It will be broken down into various groups such as Workspace, Lighting, StarterPack, Players...etc. To view what is inside of a service group, simply click the small gray arrow to the left of it. All objects that you see in your place and most scripts will be inside the Workspace group. If an object contains other objects (
       <em>
        such as decals
       </em>
       ), it will have a small arrow as well. To close a group and hide its contents, simply click the arrow once more.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Properties
       </strong>
       <br/>
       This section shows you a list of properties an object has such as size, rotation, if it is able to be moved (
       <em>
        anchored
       </em>
       )...etc. The object must be selected to view the properties of it.
      </li>
     </ul>

      Working the Camera
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The camera is simple to work. Unlike when playing your experience online, the camera isn't restricted to one object (
      <em>
       e.g. your head
      </em>
      ). Instead it allows you to move it anywhere and at any angle. Use either W, A, S, D, or the Arrow Keys to move the camera forward, backward, left, and right. Click and hold the right mouse button and move the mouse to rotate your view. Rolling your mouse's scroll wheel up will zoom in while rolling it down will zoom out.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
     </p>
     <h1>
      Adding and Moving Objects
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Adding Bricks, Scripts, and Models (
      <em>
       as well as many other objects
      </em>
      ) while in Edit Mode is easy and there are several ways to accomplish this. The first option is to simply right-click on a blank space in the experience window, choose Insert Object, and select the thing you want to add to your place.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Alternatively, you can use the many buttons in the Model tab to quickly insert a multitude of things such as parts, bricks, effects, spawn points, scripts...etc. Lastly, to make placement easier, you can drag and drop many different bricks, models or scripts into the experience window by using the Toolbox on the left of the screen. If this is not visible, you can reopen it from within the View tab.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Moving things that you've already added to your experience is even easier! First, simply click on the Move icon located in the Model tab at the top of the screen. You can then move an object freely by clicking and dragging it around the experience window. If you want to move it only up/down, left/right, or in/out then just click on the object to display a series of arrows. Click on the one pointing in the direction you would like to move and drag your mouse.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      <em>
       Note: Some objects, like sparkles and scripts, are not visible and therefore cannot be moved.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
     </p>
     <h1>
      The Toolbox
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The Toolbox allows developers to drag and drop models, decals, and more that are created by other players into their place. This is similar to the Insert Object option inside of the right-click menu, but offers pre-made material and player-created content.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
     </p>
     <h1>
      Resizing and Rotating Objects
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      To resize bricks, click the Scale button located in the Model tab, select a brick, and small dots should appear on the top, bottom, left, right, front and back of the object. Click and drag the dot corresponding to the side that you would like to shrink or stretch.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      <em>
       Note: Models are unable to be resized.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      To rotate an object, simply click on it followed by the Rotate button located in the Model tab. This will surround the selected item with six dots and three circles. Click one of the dots and drag your mouse to twist or tilt your selection inside of the circle that matches the dot's color.

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Roblox Studio now also allows you to easily add or manipulate the terrain of your world to create beautiful landscapes. You can find the appropriate tools within the Terrain tab. For details on what each of these tools does, read the

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Once you're done with your place, or you want to see what something does before publishing it, click the

       Play

      button located in the
      <strong>
       Test tab

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If you want to see what your place would be like with several other people participating, you can emulate a server. To do this, go to the Test tab and select how many players you would like to emulate in the drop-down box located in the Clients and Servers area. After doing this, click start. This will open several other Studio windows. One of these windows will act as the server while the others will allow you to control one of the various fake players that will be added into the experience. To stop testing, click the Cleanup button in the original Studio window.
