      You may see an experience that you think would work as a good starting point for your own experience. The good news is that some builders encourage you to use their experiences for this purpose! However, an experience can only be copied if the notice "This experience's source can be copied" is listed on the experience's

      </a>
      for further details.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the experience is allowed to be copied, then the following steps will help you use it as a starting point for your own experience:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       Go to the experience's details page
      </li>
      <li>
       Click on the icon that looks like three dots to the upper-right of its title
      </li>
      <li>
       Click
       <strong>
        Edit
       </strong>
       in the menu that pops up
      </li>
      <li>
       This will open the experience in Studio where you can do one of two things:
      </li>
     </ol>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Choose File &gt;
       <strong>
        Save As
       </strong>
       , and save the experience to your computer. You can then edit the experience to your liking.
      </li>
      <li>
       Choose File &gt;
       <strong>
        Publish to Roblox As
       </strong>
       and then either upload over an existing experience or create a new one.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent5">
      <em>
       Note: Before deciding to publish a copied experience, be sure to first ask permission from the creator. If the player's experience is not allowed to be copied,  and you want to make your own version, be sure to ask the creator for permission first. It's polite.
