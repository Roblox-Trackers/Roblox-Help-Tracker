     <p>
      Your place can be configured to show how chat messages are shown in-experience. This allows flexible options to best let players communicate while playing your experience.
     </p>
     <h1>
      Chat Modes
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      There are two default chat styles available within your place.
     </p>
     <h2 class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Classic
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      This will display chat messages within the upper-left chat window of the default experience screen. These messages are listed in chronological order, newest to oldest being bottom to top. This lets players converse globally on a server with no restrictions to physical location within your experience's world.
     </p>
     <h2 class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Bubble
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      This will display chat messages above the character heads of players who are talking. This allows conversations to be restricted to the physical locations of the players in your experience's place.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Both chat modes can be enabled at the same time, if desired.
     </p>
