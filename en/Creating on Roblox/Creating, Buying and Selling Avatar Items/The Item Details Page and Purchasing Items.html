      When looking through the Marketplace or someone's Inventory, you can view more details about a specific item by tapping on it. The item's detail page will load with more information about it and a purchase option, if it's on sale. An example of a detail page:

      Basic Item Information

     <p>
      Details on an item's page are broken down into the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Item Name
       </strong>
       - This is found to the right of the item picture
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Type
       </strong>
       - Lets you know if it's a gear, hat, decal, etc. If you found the item through a search and not by searching categories, please make sure the item category matches the type that you want to get before buying.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Tradable
       </strong>
       - Found under Type. If this says

       <strong>
        Description
       </strong>
       - This will tell you a little about the item. If the description is too long to fit into the default amount of space, you'll see a

     <h2>
      Item Image
     </h2>
     <p>
      Under the title and category, you will see a picture of what the item looks like. In the lower right hand corner of the image, you'll see a 2D or 3D button. You click the button to change how the item is displayed. While the 3D model will spin by default, there are a couple of things that you can do to control it:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Click and drag the model to rotate it
      </li>
      <li>
       Use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      You can also see how the item fits on your avatar by tapping the
      <strong>
       Try On
      </strong>
      button or simply tapping the item in the app.
     </p>
     <p>
      For animations, you can see a preview of the animation on a test avatar or on your own avatar in the app. In the lower right hand corner of the preview, you can play or stop the animation. For animation packs, you can also switch which animation to preview with the buttons along the bottom.

     <h1>
      Item Cost and Purchasing
     </h1>
     <p>
      To the right of the item's price, you will see a green
      <strong>
       Buy
      </strong>
      button. If you currently have enough Robux for the purchase (your balance will appear in the upper right corner of the screen), you can click that
      <strong>
       Buy
      </strong>
      button to purchase it. If this button is faded and not clickable, then the item is not able for purchase.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h2>
      What if it's Limited or Limited U?
     </h2>
     <p>
      If that is the case, then this box will contain slightly different information. These items are only sold for a limited period of time or are limited in quantity after which Premium subscribers are able to sell their own copies. As a result, the price listed will be the lowest price the item is currently being sold for. Clicking the
      <strong>
       Buy
      </strong>
      button will buy the item at the displayed cost.
     </p>
     <p>
      <em>
       Note: Be sure to look at the confirmation screen carefully before completing your transaction. Once a purchase has been confirmed, refunds will
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       be able to be issued.

      Resales

     <p>
      If the item is
      <em>
       Limited
      </em>
      or
      <em>
       Limited U
      </em>
      and being sold by Premium subscribers, the Price Chart and Resellers' information will be displayed on the page.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Resellers section displays the list of users who are currently selling the item and the price in order from lowest to highest, which usually looks like this:
     </p>
     <p>
      <img alt="Resellers.png" src="/hc/article_attachments/15904722829076"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Price Chart tracks the average price over the selected time period. An example of this can be seen below:
     </p>
     <p>

      <em>
       Note: The drop down menu for the Price Chart can be changed to reflect 30 days, 90 days or 180 days.
