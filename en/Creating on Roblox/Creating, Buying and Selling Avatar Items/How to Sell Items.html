      Right now only an account with a membership can participate in private selling. Additionally, as with trading, only items marked as Limited or Limited U are able to be sold. If an item is Limited or Limited U, there will be an icon declaring it as such underneath the item's picture when viewing its details page or when browsing the catalog.

      Pricing Your Sales

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Be careful when setting your sale price. If you set the wrong price and it sells (a low price can cause the item to sell almost immediately), Roblox will not be able to reverse the transaction.
