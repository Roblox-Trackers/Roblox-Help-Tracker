      </li>

       On the menu that pops up, select
       <strong>
        Trade Items

      </li>
      <li>
       Select item(s) that you want to trade away. (They will appear in the
       <em>
        Your Offer
       </em>
       list.)
      </li>
      <li>
       Select item(s) that you want to trade for. (They will appear on
       <em>
        Your Request
       </em>
       list.)
      </li>
      <li>
       You can also choose to sweeten the deal by including some additional Robux, but please keep in mind that there will be a 30% transaction fee removed once the offer gets accepted.
      </li>
      <li>
       Review the trade to make sure you like it.
       <br/>
       <em>
        Note: Roblox cannot undo a trade so you should be certain you are happy with the trade.
       </em>
      </li>
      <li>
       Click on the
       <strong>
        Make Offer
       </strong>
       button to submit the trade. Once you submit, a pop up will appear for you to confirm the trade request. (Submitting a new trade will notify the other player via a private message.)
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent4">
      <em>
       Note: The amount of Robux cannot exceed 50% of the current offer, calculated after the transaction fee is removed. For example, if you offer an item that is worth 300 Robux, you cannot add more than 150 Robux--post transaction fee--to the offer.
