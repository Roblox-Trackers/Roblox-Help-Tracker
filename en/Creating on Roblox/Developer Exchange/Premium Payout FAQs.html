       Q: How do I know what benefits I’ll get in a specific experience with my Premium subscription?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: Disclosing specific in-experience benefits is up to the discretion of the experience developers. Benefits might be found in the experience description, in the experience, or anywhere else developers describe their experience.

      <strong>
       Q: How does my Premium subscription help my favorite experiences?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: If you are a Premium subscriber, a portion of your subscription fee will go directly to your most played experiences. The more you play your favorite experiences on Roblox, the more the developers of those experiences will make from Premium Payouts.

       Q: How is the Premium Playtime Score calculated?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: Playtime score is determined by the proportion of time a Premium user spends in your experience over other experiences. Playtime score is calculated daily.

      <strong>
       Q: How are the earnings distributed for group experiences?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: Group distribution for Premium Payouts works just like any other earning from experience passes or developer products. So if your group has automatic distribution set up, earnings from Premium Payouts will honor that.

      <strong>
       Q: Why is there a 28 day delay on payouts?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: You’ll receive Premium Payouts on a daily basis, 28 days after each measured day. For example, you will receive your payout for February 19th’s engagement on March 18th (28 days later) and February 20th’s engagement on March 19th (also 28 days later). Payouts lag behind engagement by a month because we look at a player’s engagement for the entire month of their subscription. This allows us to give you a proportion of their membership fee for that month. The lag also helps us ensure that your payout is not affected by refunds or other payment complications.

      <strong>
       Q: How are my Premium Payout Robux Earned related to my Premium Playtime Score?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: Your Premium Playtime Score gives you an early, directional indication of how your Premium Payout will change next month. However, the relationship is not exact because your Premium Playtime Score is calculated on a daily basis but your payout is calculated over the entire past month.

      <strong>
       Q: Why aren’t paid experiences eligible for Premium Payouts?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: We want to enable a frictionless experience for Premium subscribers so experiences that charge for access are currently not included in Premium Payouts

      <strong>
       Q: How much can I expect to be paid?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: You can use the Premium payout chart to anticipate how much you can expect each month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Q: How long should I wait to see what impact Premium Payouts will have for me?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: We recommend being patient when testing Premium Payouts and experiment with it - test new features to increase engagement, tweak them and use dashboards to measure impact. Give it a few months in order to see how much Premium Payouts benefits you.

      <strong>
       Q: Why is my Premium Payout Robux earned line dotted?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: Your Premium Payout Robux Earned line will initially be dotted because we are showing you a prediction of how much Robux you will earn from that day of Premium playtime in your experience. We’ll need a month to process your Robux earned and make sure that the amount is accurate. Once we’ve finished analyzing, the Robux earned line for that day will be included in your

      <strong>
       Q: Do I need to do anything specific to receive Premium Payouts?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: If your experience is already popular among Premium subscribers, you will receive a payout without having to change your experience. As Premium subscribers spend more of their time in your experience, you should see payouts increase.
