       DevEx Program Overview
      </strong>
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Roblox Developer Exchange Program (also known as DevEx) is a program that allows Roblox developers to exchange their Earned Robux for real money. While anyone can use Roblox Studio to learn to code, create experiences to enjoy with their friends, and even earn some Robux, only some developers will be able to meet the high requirements (described below) to earn real money through DevEx. Reaching this level of success typically requires a lot of time and talent. It may also require you to hire others to help you or to spend money to promote the experiences you create. Even then, there is no guarantee of success. But we can guarantee that you will have fun unleashing your creativity on Roblox.

        Step 1: Meet DevEx Eligibility Requirements
       </strong>
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      Eligibility to participate in DevEx is solely up to Roblox, and the requirements may be changed by Roblox at any time by updating the DevEx Terms. To participate in DevEx you must meet all the following minimum requirements (“the DevEx Eligibility Requirements”):
     </p>

      <li>
       Be at least 13 years of age or older;
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
       Have a Roblox-verified email address;
      </li>
      <li>
       Have a valid

      <strong>
       Ongoing Service Requirements for Developers
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      To participate in DevEx, you must meet the “Ongoing Service Requirements for Developers,” which are to provide an on-going services that complies with the Roblox

      <strong>
       *Note:
      </strong>
      We reserve the right to review activity on accounts to assess the validity of Earned Robux balances, and to deny payment to any user that we feel has violated the terms or the spirit of our program.
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">
       <strong>
        Step 2: Gather your payment method and tax information
       </strong>
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       **This step is required for first-time users that have never participated in DevEx**
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In the later part of the DevEx process, you will be
      <strong>
       required
      </strong>
      to provide your payment method, and tax form on the DevEx portal if your DevEx request is approved to move forward with the next steps.
     </p>
     <p>
      You will be given 1 week to complete registration (to enter your payment method
      <strong>
       and
      </strong>
      tax form), otherwise we will not be able to process your DevEx request, and it will result in the decline of your DevEx request.
     </p>
     <p>
      We highly recommend that you have these documents ready prior to submitting your DevEx request.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Step 3: Submit DevEx Request
       <br/>
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Once you have agreed to the DevEx Terms of Use and meet the DevEx requirements, you can submit a DevEx request on the DevEx cashout page in the creator dashboard.
     </p>
     <p>
      Follow these steps to get to the Developer Exchange Cashout Page:
     </p>

     <p>
      <strong>
       **Note**:
      </strong>
      Do not complete your DevEx request with the information of someone other than the Roblox account holder. Any discrepancies on your DevEx request will delay your DevEx process significantly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Step 4: What happens after submitting a DevEx request?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       First-Time Users:
      </strong>
      Please allow around 2 weeks for your request to be reviewed and processed by the DevEx team. First time DevEx participants may experience a longer wait time. Suspicious activity or inaccuracies in the information submitted on your DevEx request and/or DevEx portal will delay your DevEx process significantly or result in your DevEx request being declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       **Returning Users**
      </strong>
      Please allow 2 to 3 business days (excluding holidays) for your DevEx request to be reviewed and processed. Please note, all DevEx requests are reviewed for eligibility upon submission. Check out the DevEx portal (Tipalti) section for the payment processing times after your payment has been processed on Tipalti.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Step 5: After your DevEx request is reviewed and approved
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      You will be sent an invitation to create a DevEx portal from
      <span>
       <a href="mailto:no-reply@roblox.com">
        no-reply@roblox.com.
       </a>
      </span>
      Check your spam folder if you do not see the invitation in your inbox.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Step 6: Complete DevEx portal registration
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      You’ll need to create your DevEx portal, and you
      <strong>
       must
      </strong>
      enter your payment method, and tax form within
      <strong>
       one
      </strong>
      week of receiving the registration link. We cannot process your documents if they are not provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you do not register at all and if all of your documents are not provided then your DevEx request will be declined after one week of receiving a registration link.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Step 7: After Completing Registration
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       First-Time Users:
      </strong>
      You don’t need to do anything else. The DevEx team will process your DevEx request, this step typically takes 2 to 3 business days. Once your payment is paid by Tipalti, additional processing time will be required before you receive your payment.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can check out the DevEx portal (Tipalti)
      <span>

           <br/>
           DevEx requests can be declined for multiple reasons. Common DevEx rejection reasons are detailed below:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           • Failure to complete registration/submit tax forms on the DevEx portal within 1 week
           <br/>

           • Account Theft

           • Attempting to exchange Robux for real currency other than through DevEx

           • Other suspicious activity that is used to exploit other Roblox users or Roblox feature
           <br/>
           • Any illegal or unethical activities
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Please note that if your request is rejected for a Terms of Use violation then we will not be able to provide exact details on why you were rejected but only general information.

           <br/>
           <br/>
           Approval of your previous DevEx request in no way is a guarantee that your future DevEx requests will be processed. All DevEx requests are reviewed for eligibility upon submission.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           If activity that violates the Terms of Use or the spirit of the program is identified at any time, Roblox reserves the right to decline the DevEx request.

           </strong>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Minor moderation infractions or having a moderation history does not necessarily mean that your account(s) are ineligible for DevEx. We do take into consideration the type of infraction and the timing of it during the review process.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           There are certain Terms of Use violations that are particularly egregious that can result in your DevEx request being declined regardless of the timing of the infraction.

           DevEx participants can have a completed DevEx request once a calendar month.

         <br/>
         Group payouts are considered earned if the group funds are composed of bona fide sales of virtual items/clothing. Please note, we check all sales and group funds for validity. If you receive group funds from a group that earned the Robux fraudulently or against Roblox TOS, then those will not count towards your earned Robux balance.

         <br/>
         There isn’t one particular thing you can look at to ensure you are collaborating with a party that is earning funds legitimately. To reduce your risk, please consider the following:
         <br/>
         <br/>
         • The length of time that you have associated with the group/group owner
         <br/>
         • Play their games, see what they have published in the past
         <br/>
         • Research the group owner and games associated with the group. (Group name, ranks, games, logo, description, etc).

           Tipalti is a third-party payment processor that we have partnered with to process DevEx payments. Once you submit a DevEx request, and if it is approved to proceed to the next step you will be sent an invitation to get setup on the DevEx portal.

           You must provide your payment method and tax form within 1 week of receiving the registration link. If you do not complete registration, we cannot process your payment.

           <br/>
           <br/>
           Tipalti offers ACH, eCheck, Paypal, checks, and Wire transfers. Some payment methods’ availability depends on your country, which you will be able to see on your DevEx portal or you can view this in the Payment Methods Coverage link below. When selecting your payment method please take into consideration the transaction fee and foreign exchange fee (FX fee) when selecting your payment method.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Please note, we are not able to remit payments to certain countries, entities, or individuals because of legal or other considerations. But we are currently able to make payments to DevEx participants in over one hundred different countries.
           <br/>

            Payment Method Fees on the DevEx portal
           </strong>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           You will be able to see the fees that are associated with that payment method. Some payment method fees are higher than others, we recommend that you select the one that works best for you. Example: PayPal fees are higher than traditional payment methods.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Additionally, we are unable to change the fees associated with your payment.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Transaction fees are assessed on each payment (which will be paid from any amounts that would otherwise be owed to you hereunder). These fees are charged by our DevEx portal provider (Roblox does not assess any fees in addition to those charged by our provider), and Fees vary depending on payment method chosen. Please see the DevEx portal for information regarding fee schedules

           After your DevEx payment has been processed and your payment status is paid, there will be an additional processing time for you to receive your payment.

           Please note, the processing time may vary by payment method and the country the payment is being sent to. You can reference the chart below for the estimated processing time by payment method:
