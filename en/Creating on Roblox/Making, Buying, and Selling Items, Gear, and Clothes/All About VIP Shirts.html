      What is a VIP shirt?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      A VIP shirt is a developer-made feature where players purchase a certain shirt that, when worn while playing a certain experience, will allow the player to have extra abilities/items in a place. This is determined by the experience's owner through coding. Any player can use these VIP abilities if they are able to purchase the shirt.

       Note: If you have an issue with any VIP t-shirt/shirt access that is not working, you will need to contact the creator of that shirt to let them know.

      While you may still find VIP shirts available in some experiences, many developers have chosen to instead use the

      Can I get anything that gives VIP abilities in all places?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      There is no one shirt or pass that provide VIP access for all places on Roblox. If somebody offers you a shirt and says that it will make you a VIP everywhere, it's not true and you can report them via the

      Although memberships do not give you VIP access to all places, what they do give you is a lot of other awesome benefits. You can read about all the benefits by
