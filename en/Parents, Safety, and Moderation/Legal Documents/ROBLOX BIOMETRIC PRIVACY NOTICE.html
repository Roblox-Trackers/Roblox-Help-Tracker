      Why are you receiving this notice?
     </h2>
     <p>
      This biometric privacy notice explains how Roblox collects, uses, shares, retains, and destroys (collectively, “processes”) your Biometric Data when you use our services. “Biometric Data” includes: (i) “Biometric Identifiers,” which are data generated by measurements of your biological characteristics, such as your retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or a scan of your hand or face geometry; and (ii) “Biometric Information,” which is information based on a Biometric Identifier that can be used to identify you.
     </p>
     <p>
      Please review this notice carefully. By using the Roblox identity verification process, you consent to the collection, use, sharing, and retention of your Biometric Data as described in this notice.

     <h2>
      How do we process it?
     </h2>
     <ul>
      <li>
       We use a service provider, Veriff, to assist with our identity and age verification process.
      </li>
      <li>
       To confirm your identity, Veriff will capture a photo of your ID and a selfie. Veriff then compares the face geometry extracted from your ID and selfie, as well as the date of birth from your ID, to securely verify your age and identity.
      </li>
      <li>
       Limited Roblox personnel may access the photo of your ID and selfie stored by Veriff for compliance purposes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>
      How long do we retain your Biometric Data?
     </h2>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Roblox does not receive a copy of, or have access to, your Biometric Data.
      </li>
      <li>
       Our service provider, Veriff, deletes your Biometric Data within 90 days after collection, unless required by law (such as a warrant or subpoena) to keep your Biometric Data for a longer period.
       <br/>
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>
      What happens to your Biometric Data at the end of the retention period?
     </h2>

       Our service provider, Veriff, permanently erases your Biometric Data at the end of the retention period described above such that it cannot be recovered or reconstructed.
