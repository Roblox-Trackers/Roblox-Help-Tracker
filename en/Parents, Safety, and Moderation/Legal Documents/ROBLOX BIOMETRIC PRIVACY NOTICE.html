      Why are you receiving this notice?
     </h2>
     <p>
      This biometric privacy notice explains how Roblox collects, uses, shares, retains, and destroys (collectively, “processes”) your Biometric Data when you use our services. “Biometric Data” includes: (i) “Biometric Identifiers,” which are data generated by measurements of your biological characteristics, such as your retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or a scan of your hand or face geometry; and (ii) “Biometric Information,” which is information based on a Biometric Identifier that can be used to identify you.
     </p>
     <p>
      Please review this notice carefully. By using the Roblox identity verification process, you consent to the collection, use, sharing, and retention of your Biometric Data as described in this notice.
     </p>
     <h2>
      What type of Biometric Data do we process?
     </h2>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Face geometry.
       <br/>
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>
      How do we process it?
     </h2>
     <ul>
      <li>
       We use service providers, Veriff and Persona, to assist with our identity and age verification process.
      </li>
      <li>
       To confirm your identity, Veriff or Persona captures a photo of your ID and a selfie. Veriff or Persona then reviews the face geometry extracted from your ID and selfie, and analyzes the age of your face to compare it to the date of birth from your ID. This is done to securely verify your age and identity, as well as to detect fraud.
      </li>
      <li>
       Limited Roblox personnel may access the photo of your ID and selfie stored by Veriff or Persona for compliance purposes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>
      How long do we retain your Biometric Data?
     </h2>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Roblox does not receive a copy of, or have access to, your Biometric Data.
      </li>
      <li>
       Our service provider, Veriff or Persona, will respectively delete your Biometric Data within 90 days after collection, unless required by law (such as a warrant or subpoena) to keep your Biometric Data for a longer period.
       <br/>
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h2>
      What happens to your Biometric Data at the end of the retention period?
     </h2>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Both our service providers, Veriff and Persona, permanently erase your Biometric Data at the end of the retention period described above such that it cannot be recovered or reconstructed.
       <br/>
       <br/>
      </li>
     </ul>
