      Assistant is a tool provided by Roblox as an option to help you create experiences faster by providing suggestions for answering questions, generating and explaining code, and populating scenes by inserting and arranging assets. BY PROCEEDING OR USING ASSISTANT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE, ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THE BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, YOU MAY NOT USE ASSISTANT.

      Assistant is part of the “Services” as defined in the Roblox Terms of Use (the “Terms”). Capitalized terms not separately defined in these Assistant Supplemental Terms and Disclaimer (“Supplemental Terms”) have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms. Your use of Assistant is voluntary and is subject to the Terms, including the Creator Terms and the Roblox Community Standards, in addition to these Supplemental Terms. You remain responsible for ensuring that all content, including code, images, textures and any other UGC that you make available on the Services, including UGC suggested by Assistant, complies with the Terms and these Supplemental Terms. Among other things, you must (i) use Assistant in a lawful manner and in compliance with all applicable laws, (ii) use Assistant in a manner that does not infringe or attempt to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any rights of Roblox or any other person or entity; (iii) not reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive or gain access to Assistant; (iv) not obtain and share sensitive personal information of others; and (v) not generate unsafe, uncivil, or any other prohibited UGC.

      In addition, you must not, and you agree that you will not, use Assistant: (i) in any way that violates any applicable national, federal, state, local, or international law or regulation; (ii) for the purpose of exploiting, harming, or attempting to exploit or harm to minors in any way; (iii) to generate or disseminate verifiably false information and/or content with the purpose of harming others; (iv) to generate or disseminate personal identifiable information that can be used to harm an individual; (v) to defame, disparage, or otherwise harass others; (vi) for fully automated decision making that adversely impacts an individual’s legal rights or otherwise creates or modifies a binding, enforceable obligation; (vii) for any use intended to or which has the effect of discriminating against or harming individuals or groups based on online or offline social behavior or known or predicted personal or personality characteristics; (viii) to exploit any of the vulnerabilities of a specific group of persons based on their age, social, physical, or mental characteristics, in order to materially distort the behavior of a person pertaining to that group in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological harm; (ix) for any use intended to, or which has the effect of discriminating against, individuals or groups based on legally protected characteristics or categories; (x) to provide medical advice and medical results interpretation; (xi) to generate or disseminate information for the purpose to be used for administration of justice, law enforcement, immigration, or asylum processes, such as predicting an individual will commit fraud/crime commitment (e.g. by text profiling, drawing causal relationships between assertions made in documents, indiscriminate and arbitrarily-targeted use); and (xii) to create, train, or improve any other similar or competing product.

      Services including Assistant may include or make available Third-Party Services. As set forth in the Terms, Roblox neither controls nor takes responsibility for any Third-Party Services, including without limitation, how a third party may collect, use, or store your information. You understand that your use of the Services, including Assistant and, by extension, Third-Party Services, may subject you to fees, terms, and/or policies, such as a privacy policy, that are not controlled by Roblox. By your use of the Services, including Assistant and integrated Third-Party Services, you agree to pay any fees and to follow any terms, conditions, and policies presented by those Third-Party Services.

      Roblox may use text and other prompts you input into Assistant in connection with the Services, and you grant Roblox a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right and license to use such prompts for any business purpose in connection with operating, providing, or improving the Services.

      Due to its nature, Assistant may generate incorrect, misleading, offensive, unreliable, or other information that is not useful for your purposes and that may be the same, similar, or different among users. Assistant provides suggestions for your convenience and is not intended to provide factual information or advice. YOUR USE OF ASSISTANT IS AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND ASSISTANT IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT CONDITION, WARRANTY, GUARANTEE OR REPRESENTATION OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AVAILABILITY, OR ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED USE). ROBLOX AND ITS AFFILIATED PARTIES (AS DEFINED IN THE TERMS) MAKE NO WARRANTY ABOUT CONTENT OR INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE THROUGH OR FROM ASSISTANT, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM THAT ANY DATA, CONTENT OR INFORMATION RESULTING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF ASSISTANT IS ACCURATE OR CAN OR SHOULD BE RELIED UPON BY YOU FOR ANY PURPOSE.
     </p>
     <p>
      As set forth in the Terms, you shall and hereby agree to defend, hold harmless and indemnify Roblox and its Affiliated Parties from and against every claim, liability, damage, loss, and expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to, use of, or alleged use of the Services, including Assistant, and your violation of these Supplemental Terms.
