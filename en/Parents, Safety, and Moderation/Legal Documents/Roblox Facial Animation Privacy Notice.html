       What are facial animations?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Certain Roblox services can use video and live camera input that shows movements of your facial features, like closing your eyes and opening your mouth, and translate that input into animations of the facial features of your Roblox avatar. Think of it like controlling your avatar’s face like a puppet, but your face is pulling the strings! These services include Animation Capture - Face and Use camera to animate your avatar with your movement (collectively, our “animation services”). This notice explains how Roblox collects, uses, shares, retains, and destroys (collectively, “processes”) information regarding the movements of your facial features when you use our animation services.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Please review this notice carefully. By using the Roblox animation services, you consent to the practices described in this notice. Animation Capture - Face is disabled by default and each time you engage with animation services, you will need to enable the feature for that session by starting the recording. You can disable Use camera to animate your avatar with your movement at any time by going to your Privacy Settings.

       How do Roblox animation services work?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Roblox animation services work by analyzing video of your face to detect movements of your facial features, like closing your eyes, winking, opening your mouth, smiling, and frowning. This analysis happens entirely on your device and does not send data to Roblox or any third parties.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       For Animation Capture - Face, this analysis creates animation key frames that you can use to animate your avatar or share with others so they can animate their avatars.
      </li>
      <li>
       For Use camera to animate your avatar with your movement, this analysis happens in a real-time experience and does not create key frames that can be saved or shared.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Roblox does not use the video of your face or the analysis of movements of your facial features to identify you personally. Nevertheless, depending on your location, applicable laws might define this data as a biometric identifier or biometric information.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       How long is the video and analysis of movements of your facial features retained?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      When the Roblox animation services analyze video of your face to detect movements of your facial features, this video and analysis information is retained on your device in temporary memory only as long as necessary to generate the animation key frames used for animating your avatar. After that, the video and analysis information is erased from memory.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       For Animation Capture - Face, animation key frames created by this process are no different from animation key frames created through any other process. You can keep them as long as you like.
      </li>
      <li>
       For Use camera to animate your avatar with your movement, animation key frames created by this process are deleted in real-time after they have been used and cannot be saved.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Who has access to the video and analysis of movements of your facial features?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The video and analysis information used by the Roblox animation services stays on your device and is not shared with Roblox or any third parties.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       For Animation Capture - Face, animation key frames created by this process are no different from animation key frames created through any other process. How you share them is up to you.
      </li>
      <li>
       For Use camera to animate your avatar with your movement, animation key frames created by this process are deleted in real-time after they have been used to animate your avatar and cannot be shared.
