     </p>
     <p>
      A small percentage of individuals may experience seizures when exposed to certain visual images, including light patterns or flashing lights.  Exposure to these patterns or backgrounds on a screen while playing or watching games may induce seizures in these individuals, including in persons who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy.  Seizures may result in loss of consciousness and injury, including injury from falling or striking nearby objects. If you or anyone in your family have a history of seizures, including any epileptic condition, consult your physician prior to playing or watching games.
