        <u>
         Determination to Cash Out
        </u>
        . Based on your account information, on the requirements below, and on applicable laws, we will make a determination in our sole discretion of whether you are eligible to Cash Out. Please note that (a) the maximum value for Cash Outs cannot exceed the Cash Outs monthly limit and (b) you are not allowed to initiate a Cash Out more than once a calendar month. Please also note that eligibility to Cash Out is reviewed after you submit the request to Cash Out, described in Section 2 above. Do not contact us asking if you are eligible or for your account to be pre-reviewed for eligibility. Eligibility can only be assessed once a Cash Out request is submitted. The eligibility requirements are as follows:

          ;
         </li>
         <li>
          Minimum of 100,000 earned Robux in your account. In order to protect against money laundering and comply with applicable law, we limit all Cash Outs to "earned" Robux. Robux are considered "earned" if you receive them by receiving payments from a bona fide third party transaction through the Services for (a) virtual items (such as clothing for an avatar) that you created or (b) virtual things in your game or for your game or experience. This means that Robux acquired in other ways (e.g., receiving Robux as part of a membership plan or referral bonus, a purchase of Robux or gift card, or trading/selling virtual goods that you did not create) are not considered "earned". We will determine how much you are eligible to Cash Out by totaling the amount of Robux earned (over the lifetime of the account) and subtracting the amounts previously paid out to you through DevEx;

          Community member in good standing and at all times during your use of the Services strictly complied with the General Terms (including the Rules of Conduct and the Ongoing Service Requirements for Developers, set out in item 4 below). In our sole discretion, we may choose to waive any of your minor moderation infractions. But, by way of example, the following will make you ineligible for a Cash Out: scamming, phishing, false advertising, attempting to exchange Robux for real currency other than through DevEx, any illegal or unethical activities.

        <u>
         Ongoing Service Requirements for Developers
        </u>
        . The games, experiences and virtual goods that you create and make available are only part of the service that you are providing. We expect and require that anyone participating in DevEx to provide a full range of services to the community, which include the following:
        <ol>
         <li>
          Providing an on-going experience that complies with our community standards and guidelines. This means that you will need to work with our Customer Service and Moderation teams and our community members to resolve any issues that do not comply with those guidelines.
         </li>
         <li>
          Updating your content for security, technical and other reasons. For example, you will need to make sure your content complies with Roblox’s latest technical and security updates and best practices.
         </li>
         <li>
          Providing assistance to Roblox for legal and compliance reasons. For example, we may ask your assistance with the DMCA take down process relating to intellectual property issues (pursuant to our General Terms).
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li>
        <u>
         Acknowledgements and Further Agreements
        </u>
        . In order to participate in DevEx, you further acknowledge and agree to the following:
        <ol>
         <li>
          Clicking the "Cash Out" button does not guarantee that you are eligible to, in fact, Cash Out. When you click that button, Roblox will determine if you are eligible to Cash Out. If that determination concludes that you are eligible, then Roblox will Cash Out your Robux.
         </li>
         <li>
          Prior to any payments being made, Roblox requires you to have an IRS form W-9 (for U.S. taxpayers) or W-8 (for non-U.S. taxpayers) on file with us. All payments made to U.S. users (other than for certain limited exceptions due to reporting requirements) will be reported to the IRS and to you using a form 1099. Payments made to non-U.S. users will not be reported to their home countries.
         </li>
         <li>
          Transaction fees are assessed on each payment (which will be paid from any amounts that would otherwise be owed to you hereunder). Fees vary depending on payment method chosen. Please see the DevEx portal for information regarding fee schedules.
         </li>
         <li>
          You are responsible for any taxes that may be owed due to a Cash Out. Roblox considers the Cash Out payments to be payments for the services you have provided. All participants (whether you live in the US or elsewhere) are responsible for ensuring that all payments received are reported to the proper taxing authorities. Income that minors earn can impact their parents’ tax returns.
         </li>
         <li>
          We may not be able to remit payments to certain countries, entities, or individuals because of legal or other considerations.
         </li>
         <li>
          Roblox reserves the right to modify, amend, or cancel the DevEx program, add, remove, or modify the eligibility requirements, and change the exchange rate for a Cash Out, all at any time and for any reason. The existence of the DevEx program today in no way creates an obligation for us to continue the program in the future, nor does it guarantee that Robux can be exchanged in the future. We reserve the right to review activity on accounts to assess the validity of Robux balances, and to deny payment to any user that we feel has violated the terms or the spirit of our program.
