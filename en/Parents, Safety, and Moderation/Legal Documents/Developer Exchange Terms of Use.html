       The Roblox Developer Exchange Program (also known as DevEx) is a program that allows Roblox creators to exchange their Earned Robux for real money. While any creator can use Roblox Studio to learn to code, create experiences or items to enjoy with their friends, and even earn some Robux, only successful creators will be able to meet the high requirements (described below) to earn money through DevEx. Reaching this level of success typically requires a lot of time, effort, skill, and strategy. Even then, there is no guarantee of earning money. Regardless of goals, be it fun or career advancement, we offer creators what they need to start building for free at create.roblox.com.

           A “Cash Out” is an option to exchange your Earned Robux for U.S. dollars at the “Current Exchange Rate for Cash Out” set forth below, which rate is subject to change at any time by Roblox by updating the DevEx Terms. If you satisfy all the DevEx Eligibility Requirements, Roblox will decide in its sole discretion whether to offer you a Cash Out and how much you are eligible to receive in a Cash Out. Under normal circumstances, a Cash Out will total the amount of Earned Robux you obtained over the lifetime of the account minus all Earned Robux previously exchanged by you through DevEx. Further information on the Cash Out process can be found at the

            The Current Exchange Rate for Cash Out is $0.0035U.S. Dollars per Earned Robux.

            You are not allowed to initiate a Cash Out more than once a month.
           </li>
           <li>
            Eligibility to Cash Out is reviewed after you submit a request to Cash Out.
           </li>
           <li>
            When you initiate Cash Out, Roblox will perform a close review of activities on your account to confirm that you earned Robux in compliance with Terms of Use and Roblox Community Standards. We are not able to predetermine your eligibility for Cash Out.

          <ol type="1">
           <li>
            Clicking the “Cash Out” button does not guarantee that you are eligible to, in fact, Cash Out. When you click that button, Roblox will then determine whether you meet the DevEx Eligibility Requirements and whether to provide a Cash Out at Roblox's discretion.
           </li>
           <li>
            Prior to any payments being made, Roblox requires you to have an IRS form W-9 (for U.S. taxpayers) or W-8 (for non-U.S. taxpayers) on file with us. All payments made to U.S. users (other than for certain limited exceptions due to reporting requirements) will be reported to the IRS and to you using a form 1099. Payments made to non-U.S. users will not be reported to their home countries.
           </li>
           <li>
            Transaction fees are assessed on each payment (which will be paid from any amounts that would otherwise be owed to you hereunder). These fees are charged by our DevEx portal provider (Roblox does not assess any fees in addition to those charged by our provider), and vary depending on payment method chosen. Please see the
            <a href="https://suppliers.tipalti.com/Roblox/Account/Login" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

            for information regarding fee schedules.
           </li>
           <li>
            You are responsible for any taxes that may be owed due to a Cash Out. Roblox considers the Cash Out payments to be payments for the services you have provided. All participants (whether you live in the US or elsewhere) are responsible for ensuring that all payments received are reported to the proper taxing authorities. Income that minors earn can impact their parents’ tax returns.
           </li>
           <li>
            We are not able to remit payments to certain countries, entities, or individuals because of legal or other considerations. But we are currently able to make payments to DevEx participants in over one hundred different countries. Check

            Roblox reserves the right to modify, amend, or cancel the DevEx program, add, remove, or modify the DevEx Eligibility Requirements, and change the Current Exchange Rate for Cash Out, all at any time and for any reason by updating the DevEx Terms. The existence of the DevEx program today in no way creates an obligation for us to continue the program in the future, nor does it guarantee that Earned Robux can be exchanged in the future. We reserve the right to review activity on accounts to assess the validity of Earned Robux balances, and to deny payment to any user that we feel has violated the terms or the spirit of our program, including but not limited to these DevEx Terms, the Roblox Terms of Use, and the Roblox Community Standards.
