      How can I give away free promo codes for virtual items?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Developers may implement promotional codes only for items in their own experience, as long as:
     </p>
     <ol class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      <li>
       The item is only usable in the experience where the code is being redeemed,
      </li>
      <li>
       The in-experience item has no value in Robux or real-world currency
      </li>
      <li>
       The code itself is published in a publicly accessible way,
      </li>
      <li>
       There is no purchase necessary to access or redeem the code, and
      </li>
      <li>
       All of the above are clearly disclosed to users in all promotional materials
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Codes used in retail bundles must include a clear disclosure to customers prior to purchase where the free code can be accessed and redeemed (e.g., “No purchase necessary for virtual in-experience item. Promo code available at [URL].”).

     <h2>
      Can I give away a code for an item available in the Roblox Marketplace?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      You may implement promotional codes only for items accessible and usable exclusively in your experiences.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h2>
      I put a promo code on the packaging of my retail item. Does that qualify as ‘publicly accessible’ to users?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Publicly accessible codes must be available on the internet (e.g., on your public website, in one of your public social media posts, in the description of your details page on Roblox). Any retail packaging must clearly disclose to customers before purchase that there is no purchase necessary to redeem the code, and indicate where the code can be found. (e.g., “No purchase necessary for virtual in-experience item. Promo code available at [URL].”)
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
     </p>
     <h2>
      I’ve seen other devs create promo codes for Marketplace items. Why is that allowed?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Roblox recently initiated a limited pilot program for some developers’ items in the Marketplace to be associated with a real-world product. We’re excited to learn more from this experiment about the potential of such a capability in our metaverse and whether it is feasible to extend it to the entire community. At this point, we have no timeline for the broader initiative, so please be patient.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h2>
      I’ve found devs selling codes off-platform that are not in your partnership program. What are you going to do about them?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      We take violations of our policies very seriously. Violators may be subject to suspensions of DevEx services, account access, or experience availability.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h2>
      What do you mean by a “free” item?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The item in your experience cannot be something that you sell for Robux or a proxy in-game currency that requires Robux. If an item is perceived as valuable because it requires a high level of skill or engagement time to earn, you may use a promo code for that item as long as it is clearly published for any user to find and freely redeemable in your experience.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h2>
      What do I do if my promotion is seasonal?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      You must make the redemption window clear to users anywhere your code is promoted. If your seasonal promo code is on retail packaging, you must either support the redemption code and the associated in-experience item for the entire retail lifecycle of your product, or make it abundantly clear on the packaging when the promotion ends, even if the package is still available on retail shelves.
