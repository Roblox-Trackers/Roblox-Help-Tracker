       Our vision is that Roblox is a
       <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2023/05/our-vision-for-all-ages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
        platform for all ages
       </a>
       with safety and civility at its foundation. Building on that vision, we are expanding our
       <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/promotion/experience-guidelines" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
        Experience Guidelines
       </a>
       to allow creators who are the age of 17 and up to create content exclusively for older audiences on Roblox. Both creators that develop this content and people who engage with it will have to be 17 or older and ID-verified to access this new category. Such content will remain inaccessible to those who are under 17 or not ID-verified.

      <p>
       These Standards apply to the 17+ Experiences you create on Roblox except where restricted by local law or regulation. We ask that you respect our Standards and each other at all times — and understand that violating them may result in enforcement action against your account(s) and content. All experiences rated All Ages, 9+, and 13+, as well as all user behavior (including text and voice chat) and assets submitted to us for moderation, must still adhere to Roblox’s core

       We’re always learning, so as our community evolves and our platform grows, these Standards may change too. When they do, we’ll let you know
