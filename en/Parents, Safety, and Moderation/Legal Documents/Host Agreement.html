      CONSENT, RELEASE OF LIABILITY, AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF TERMS
     </p>
     <p>
      PLEASE READ THIS CONSENT AND RELEASE OF LIABILITY CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU SIGN IT.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thank you for your interest in the Creator Event program. We have received your application to organize and host a Creator Event (an “Event”) for and with other Roblox users, to promote collaboration, exchange knowledge and foster communities of creators on the Roblox platform (the “Purpose”). Roblox Corporation (“we” or “Roblox”) is supportive of your Event and the Purpose, but in order to make sure you understand and agree on what is expected with respect to the Event, including its taping, we ask that you review this Consent, Release of Liability, and Acknowledgement of Terms (this “Agreement”). Subject to your agreement on and execution of this Agreement, we can approve your Event application.
     </p>
     <p>
      By signing below, you expressly acknowledge, agree and consent to the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       You will be responsible for the Event, including organizing and hosting the Event, subject to any details and specifications agreed on with Roblox, including, without limitation, the Creator Events Playbook (the “Events Playbook”), the Roblox Terms of Use, and the Roblox Community Guidelines, each of which you acknowledge that you have received and reviewed.
      </li>
      <li>
       You expressly understand, acknowledge, and agree that you, and not Roblox, are responsible for the Event, including the conduct and activities of all participants at the Event, including any speakers, moderators, and other attendees. You will use your best efforts to ensure the safety and compliance with the Events Playbook and Roblox Community Guidelines, of all attendees at the Event and to prohibit any improper or illegal conduct at the Event.
      </li>
      <li>
       Except as otherwise agreed with Roblox, you will be responsible for and supply all necessary equipment, materials, and other resources for the Event, and Roblox shall not be responsible to reimburse or otherwise make any payment to you.
      </li>
      <li>
       You are responsible for obtaining all approvals, permits, consents, and licenses, if any, necessary to organize, produce, and host the Event, including, without limitation, any consents and releases from attendees required to tape or record the Event.
      </li>
      <li>
       You may decide to tape the Event. As used herein, “tape” means video, live stream, photographs and recording of name, image, likeness, voice, conversations and sounds. You understand that Roblox may use, and allow others to use, the tape (which may include you and your name and Roblox username) in the background, in prominent ways (for example, if you are interviewed) and in other ways for promotional, marketing or other activities, including, without limitation, for use on Roblox’s social media channels. Roblox does not represent or guarantee that tape of you will in fact be used, and if Roblox does use it, it might crop, shorten, reproduce, edit, create derivatives from or otherwise alter the tape of you and will not grant any requests to edit or review any tape before or after use.
       <br/>
       You hereby grant to Roblox an unlimited, non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license to exercise all rights of whatever kind or nature now or hereafter protected by the copyright laws of the United States of America and similar laws in all foreign countries in and to the Event and any taping of the Event. In connection with Roblox’s use of any tape, you authorize and grant the absolute and irrevocable right to Roblox and/or anyone authorized by or acting on behalf of Roblox to use, reproduce, publish, and/or depict your name, voice, image and/or likeness, in any manner that Roblox deems necessary or appropriate, in any form or media, worldwide, in perpetuity, in and in connection with any of Roblox’s promotional, marketing or other activities. You acknowledge that this authorization is intended to satisfy any and all of the consent requirements of California Civil Code sections 3344 and 3344.1 and statutes of similar effect, and that you, on behalf of yourself and your assignees, heirs, guardians and legal representatives, hereby waive and release any and all claims that you may have or hereafter have against Roblox under those statutes or any other statutes or common law principles of similar effect.
      </li>
      <li>
       Except as otherwise agreed in writing with Roblox, you may not use Roblox’s logo, name or marks for any reason. Roblox may use your name and any logo and marks in promotional and marketing materials.
      </li>
      <li>
       Your organization and hosting of the Event is entirely voluntary and at your own volition, and you are solely responsible for all activities, conduct, impropriety, and property relating to the Event including, without limitation, for any injury or damage caused by a participant, including any speaker, moderator, and attendee, in connection with an Event. Roblox has not agreed to supervise any activities or person at the Event, and Roblox disclaims any and all liability for anything that happens or occurs at the Event and to Event participants. You assume all risks of loss and injury, including injury or damage to Event participants, and hold Roblox harmless therefrom.
      </li>
      <li>
       You will not conduct any improper or illegal activity at the Event and will comply with all directions and rules, including the Events Playbook, as reasonably requested by Roblox. Roblox shall have the right to terminate the Event and the attendance of any Event participant or attendee at any time, if Roblox determines that the Event or the attendance of a participant or attendee may present a security, health, safety, or other risk to the Event or to any person present at the Event.
      </li>
      <li>
       IT IS THE INTENT OF YOU AND ROBLOX THAT YOUR WAIVER OF LIABILITY SPECIFIED HEREIN AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE ENFORCED AS WRITTEN AND ARE AGREED UPON BY YOU AND ROBLOX.
      </li>
      <li>
       In accordance with your assumption of all risks in connection with the Event, you, on behalf of yourself and your employees, directors, officers, contractors, representatives, or other agents, including, for avoidance of doubt, any moderators and speakers at Events, hereby releases Roblox and any of the Roblox Parties from all actions, claims, losses, liabilities or demands that you or their assignees, heirs, guardians and representatives may have for any injury, illness, damage or death, that now exist, may exist, or previously existed, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, or suspected or unsuspected, arising from or relating to the Event and any activities taking place at or in connection with the Event.
      </li>
      <li>
       You have been made aware of, and understand, the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542 (“Section 1542”), which provides.
       <br/>
       A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.
       <br/>
       You expressly, knowingly, and intentionally waive any and all rights, benefits, and protections of Section 1542 and of any other state or federal statute or common law principle limiting the scope of a general release.
      </li>
      <li>
       You have carefully read and fully understand the above terms and conditions of this Consent and Release of Liability. You are aware and acknowledge that this Consent and Release of Liability is a release of liability and a contract between you and Roblox and that you are executing it of your own free will.
