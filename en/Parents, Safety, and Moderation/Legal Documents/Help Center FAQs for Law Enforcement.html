     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Roblox sometimes receives requests from law enforcement seeking information about users involved in a legal proceeding. If you are a law enforcement agent aiming to serve Roblox with a subpoena, search warrant, preservation request, or similar legal process, please submit your request via our portal here:
      <a href="https://app.kodex.us/roblox/signin">
       Roblox Law Enforcement Portal
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Please note that all legal processes should comply with applicable law such as
      <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2701">
       18 USC 2701-2712
      </a>
      . Roblox will not accept legal process (or any other requests for information) via email or fax, and will not respond to such requests.

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Roblox takes its usersâ€™ privacy seriously. We review all requests and legal process for facial validity and legal sufficiency, and will object when appropriate. Roblox does not waive, and expressly reserves, all available rights and objections.
