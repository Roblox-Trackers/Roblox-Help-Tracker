        About Roblox and this Privacy Policy
       </strong>
       <p>
        Roblox is an imagination platform, where users are encouraged to design, create, and interact with whatever they can imagine. As a user of the Roblox platform, you and your friends can collaborate on building or just gather and explore other users’ creations. Your privacy is important to us; this is why we created this Privacy Policy so that you are aware of what information is collected, how we use it, and who we share it with.

        How Roblox Works
       </strong>
       <p>
        <em>
         Roblox works like this:
        </em>
       </p>
       <ul class="legal">
        <li>
         A user creates a username and a virtual character that is his or her identity in the Roblox world.
        </li>
        <li>
         Registered users interact with other users through in-game or website chat, personal messaging (within the Roblox environment), user forums, groups, and other similar features, with available privacy settings designed to allow users to restrict or disable communications with other users.
        </li>
        <li>
         Each user is given one or more pieces of virtual real estate on which they can build houses, cars, machines, roller coasters, or anything else you can imagine with building blocks and code; these places are called “games.”
        </li>
        <li>
         Users search for, find, and play games made by other users; they play these games with other users from around the world, and are identified only by their username.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Roblox world includes a virtual currency known as Robux; users can earn or purchase Robux in a variety of ways and use them to buy or sell items for their characters, for in-game items, and other uses.
        </li>
        <li>
         Users who earn a large amount of Robux virtual currency are allowed to sell that currency back to Roblox subject to certain participation requirements. See our

         </a>
         for more information.
        </li>
        <li>
         Users can purchase premium services, including monthly or yearly subscriptions.
        </li>
        <li>

        Information You Provide when Setting Up an Account on Roblox
       </strong>
       <p>
        <em>
         Registered users
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        All users must create a Roblox Account to play our games. To create a Roblox account, we will ask you to create a unique username and password (so you can log in to your account), and to provide other demographic information such as your age or date of birth, gender, regional location or language preference (so we can customize your experience on Roblox).
       </p>
       <p>
        Users are encouraged not to create a username that reflects their own name or other personal information. Users should also not pick a password that is easy to guess and should not share their password.
       </p>
       <p>
        Usernames are used for participating in Service features, and we do not use them to identify individual users outside of their activities on our Service. Usernames are shared with the parties listed in Section 7 below.
       </p>
       <p>
        Users may be asked to provide or may choose to add an email address to their account for added verification and/or to enable certain features. The primary purpose for this email address is to provide account security, as this is the only way for Roblox to check the authenticity of an account owner. In this circumstance, children are asked to provide a parent email address. Users may change the email address associated with their account at any time; however, a notification will be sent to the previously provided email address upon making that change.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Additional Personal Information You Provide When Using Roblox Features
       </strong>
       <p>
        In addition to account setup on Roblox, we may collect and process personal information from you directly if you use the following features and activities (as applicable):
       </p>
       <ul class="legal">
        <li>
         <u>

         </u>
         . Users can purchase virtual currency or premium subscriptions, for example, in the form of Robux, Premium memberships, etc., and may use a variety of payment methods. When making purchases, users or their parents may be required to enter billing information, including name, billing address, credit card or other payment information, and billing email. Your billing information, transaction details, and purchase history may also be retained and used by our payment processors to resolve subsequent billing disputes and inquiries.

         <u>
          When you use our games on a VR platform

These features may include social plugins from Google, Facebook, Twitter or other platforms and may be subject to the privacy policies of these other companies as posted on their respective websites. When you use these features, certain information from your social media accounts may be accessed by or shared with Roblox, and likewise, certain information about your use of Roblox may be posted to your profile on those platforms.

        A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, for example so you don’t have to re-enter them whenever you come back to the website or browse from one page to another.
       </p>
       <p>
        A cookie can be classified by its lifespan and the domain to which it belongs. By lifespan, a cookie is either a:

         Third party advertising and ad networks

       </p>
       <p>
        Roblox partners with third-party advertisers, ad server companies, and ad networks (“third-party advertising companies”) to promote our Service. If you respond to one of our advertisements and visit or register to use our Service, we or our service providers may provide these third-party advertising companies with identifiers from your device or computer, such as an IP address or device ID, to help us analyze our user acquisition efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        For our users that are children, Roblox partners with third-party advertising companies to serve contextual advertising, cap the frequency of advertising, and related uses permitted by COPPA. Roblox does not show behaviorally-targeted or retargeted ads to children or track such users for targeted advertising purposes.
       </p>
       <p>
        NOTE: In order to disable advertising-related tracking at your request, companies may need to set an opt-out cookie on your browser. Sometimes a browser’s configuration may prevent companies from setting such cookies, for example, if your browser is set to block all third-party cookies by default. Therefore, you may need to change your browser settings to accept cookies in order to fully disable advertising-related tracking.

        Children’s Privacy and Parental Controls
       </strong>
       <p>
        We recognize that children deserve added protections with regard to their personal information and privacy online. For this reason, when children register for the Service, their account is automatically set to "Privacy Mode." This means that children users will not have access to certain features, such as social media plug-ins, some forms of third-party advertising, and certain types of notification alerts.
       </p>
       <p>
        When a child creates an account on Roblox, we may collect a username, password, birthdate, and parent’s email address. This information is used to give the child access to the Service (with certain default settings) and, if a parent’s email is provided, to communicate with the parent about the child’s account. For example, we may use the parent’s email to send an email notification about the child’s account creation and an invitation for the parent to review, update settings, and approve of their child’s account. We may use the birthdate the child provides when signing up for the Service to determine which features on Roblox the child should have access to, and to determine when the child will be given broader access to features on our Service. In general, we will not use or share account information (including personal information) from your child’s account, except for the permissible purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, and, if required by law, only with the prior verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian.
       </p>
       <p>
        To make any requests for changes to your child’s account or requests for the removal of personal information collected about you or your child from our Service (as applicable), or to request that we stop the further collection or use of your or your child’s personal information in connection with the Service (as applicable), please complete the Customer Support Form at

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        We offer all accounts, including children’s accounts, the ability to modify chat/communication settings (for example, limiting interaction to just friends or no one), as well as a special “Restricted Account Mode” which turns off all forms of chat and public commenting and which allows the user to access only a selection of filtered games on Roblox. We recommend that parents familiarize themselves with all of the safety features and parental controls available in the Settings area of the Service (a description of which can be found

       </p>
       <p>
        We proactively filter all public and comment areas of the Service (such as chat, forums, group walls, personal posts, etc.) to remove references to addresses, emails, phone numbers, or other personal information regardless of security and privacy settings. All text is also filtered for profanity, phishing, and adult or suggestive content. Our system uses a combination of human and automated processes. However, like all filtering technology, our systems are not 100% effective.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you are a child, it is a good idea to talk to and ask your parent(s) or guardian(s) for permission before using or playing on the Service. If you do not get such permission, you should not use our Service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Parents should contact Roblox immediately if they have any concerns regarding the Service, wish to review information collected from your child, or have that information modified or deleted. Please see the Contact Information section below for further details. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will delete any personal information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child’s account and/or revert them to the underage experience, as applicable.

        When a child creates an account on Roblox, we may process a username, password, birthdate and parent email address. We process this information to give the user access to the Service and to communicate with the parent about the minor’s account (if a parent email was provided). For example, we may use the parent’s email to send an email notification about the child’s account creation and an invitation for the parent to review, update settings, and approve of their child's account. We may use the birthdate the child provides when signing up for the Service to determine which features on Roblox the child should have access to and to determine when the child will turn 13 years old and can be given broader access to features on our Service. This processing activity is based on Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. b GDPR (“performance of a contract”). In general, we will not use or share account information (including personal information) from a minor’s account except for the permissible purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, and, if required by law, only with the prior verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian (Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. a and Article 8 sec. 1 GDPR).
