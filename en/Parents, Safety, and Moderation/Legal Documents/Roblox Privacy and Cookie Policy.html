       Roblox has updated our Privacy Policy effective August 1, 2023. This updated policy has been rewritten to include simpler language, to provide additional details about how we process data, and to follow a clearer format. We remain committed to creating a safe and appropriate experience for users of all ages. In addition, we subsequently will be publishing policies applicable to Korea Users, which will be published in Korean.

                A cookie is a text file that’s put on your computer or device when you visit a website. It lets the website remember what you do and any settings you choose (e.g., login information, language, font size). Cookies make your experience more convenient – for example, if the cookie remembers your log-in details, you won’t have to enter them again each time you visit the site. Some cookies last longer than others:

                <li>
                 retargeted ads – these are ads that are sent after a user starts a purchasing process but does not finish it. The ad tries to get the user to finish the purchase.

                When a child creates an account on Roblox, we may process a username, password, birthdate, and gender (gender is optional). Separate from account creation, users may optionally provide a parent email address. We process this information to give the user access to the Service and to communicate with the parent about the child’s account (if a parent email was provided). For example, we may use the parent’s email to send an email notification about the child’s account and an invitation for the parent to review the account and update settings. We may use the birthdate the child provides when signing up for the Service to determine which features on Roblox the child should have access to and to determine when the child will turn 13 years old and can be given broader access to features on our Service. This processing activity is based on Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. b GDPR (“performance of a contract”). In general, we will not use or share account information (including Personal Information) from a child’s account except for the permissible purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, and, if required by law, only with the prior verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian (Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. a and Article 8 sec. 1 GDPR).

                Please note that when users under the age of 13 register for the Service, their account is automatically set to to privacy-protective settings by default. This means that these users will not have access to certain features, such as social media plug-ins, some forms of third party advertising, and certain types of notification alerts.
               </p>
               <p>
                When a child creates an account on Roblox, we may process a username, password, birthdate, and gender (gender is optional). Separate from account creation, users may optionally provide the user access to the Service and to communicate with the parent about the child’s account (if a parent email was provided). For example, we may use the parent’s email to send an email notification about the child’s account and an invitation for the parent to review their child's account and update settings. We may use the birthdate the child provides when signing up for the Service to determine which features on Roblox the child should have access to and to determine when the child will turn 13 years old and can be given broader access to features on our Service.
               </p>
               <p>
                In general, we will not use or share account information (including Personal Information) from a child's account except for the permissible purposes stated in this Privacy Policy and, where applicable, only with the prior verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian.

                Roblox may share users’ information, including Personal Information like billing information or usernames, with our third-party agents, contractors, or service providers who are hired to perform services on Roblox’s behalf.

               </ul>
               <p>
                These agents and contractors are only allowed to use the information shared with them only for the specific tasks they’ve been hired to do and consistent with this Privacy Policy, and for no other purposes. Roblox takes steps to ensure that all service providers with access to Personal Information are capable of protecting the information we share with them.
               </p>
               <p>
                Further, the creators of the experiences you use or content you interact with will have access to your username, display name, user ID, game metrics, UGC transaction details, and your regional location (which we base on your IP address). We do not share your IP address with the creators. We provide creators with the regional location of players to determine their player base and make sure their experiences meet the legal requirements of the country you live in.
