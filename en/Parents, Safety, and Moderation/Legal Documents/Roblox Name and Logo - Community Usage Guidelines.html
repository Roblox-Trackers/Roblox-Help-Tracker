       Roblox is powered by our community of creators. Together with you, we are on a mission to power the imagination of people around the world. As you and we continue to push the boundaries of user-generated creation and play, we want to give you the tools to help showcase your passion and creativity off the platform. As such, we put together the following guidelines and rules around using the Roblox name and logo outside of the platform.
      </p>
      <ol class="legal-list">
       <li>
        <u>

         Terms of Use
        </a>
        , you may use the name “Roblox” and the Roblox logo on or with any of the following items (but not as the title of any of these items - for example, you can’t use “The Best Roblox App Ever”):
        <ol>
         <li>
          <u>
           Digital extensions/plugins for use with Roblox

         <li>
          <u>
           Complementary apps
          </u>
          . These are software applications that (a) explain or facilitate the use or enjoyment of Roblox and (b) are “true fan” types of applications (e.g., apps that test your knowledge of the history of Roblox).
         </li>
         <li>
          <u>
           Fan sites
          </u>
          . Such as websites, blogs, Twitter feeds, Twitch, YouTube pages, and other social media, videos and streams used by devotees of Roblox to discuss and encourage use of Roblox in a manner that also respects the Roblox community.
         </li>
         <li>
          <u>
           Hand-crafted products for personal use

        <u>

        </u>
        . Subject to the rules and restrictions related to advertisements and press releases you can use the name “Roblox” to promote you or your game(s) as long as the use doesn’t confuse consumers or as the name of an app or any kind of merchandise or product. In other words, you can refer to “Roblox” as the name of our platform, and you can use the name to show your interest in or affection for our platform.
       </li>
       <li>
        <u>
         The Logo “Roblox”
        </u>
        . You may not use the logo "Roblox" in the name or title of any item or product of any kind. Subject to these rules and guidelines, you are only allowed to use the logo design that is available at the following
        <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/press-kit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
         link
        </a>
        . We may alter the form of this design from time to time. You are allowed to re-size the logo as long as you do not modify the proportions. But otherwise, you cannot modify the logo design in any way and must abide by the Logo Guidelines.
