       How do we maintain the integrity of like and dislike ratings (thumbs up/thumbs down) on Roblox?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      We want to make sure that you can trust our ratings system. We screen our ratings with the aim of ensuring that we only display votes submitted by real users who have visited the experience they are rating, and that our ratings are not affected by “bot votes.”
