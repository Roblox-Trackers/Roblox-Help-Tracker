      Article (24): Average number of Roblox’s EU monthly active recipients
     </h2>
     <p>
      According to Article 24 (2) of DSA, providers of online platforms are required to publish information on the average monthly active recipients of the service in the European Union (“EU”) every six months starting from February 17, 2023. Among other things, this number is for the purpose of determining whether such providers are considered a very large online platform (“VLOP”) or very large online search engine (“VLOSE”), i.e. more than 45 million monthly active users in the EU.
     </p>
     <p>
      The estimated average number of monthly active recipients of Roblox in the EU based on the 6-month period ending on February 13, 2023 is 25.2 million.
     </p>
     <p>
      This information is being provided solely for purposes of complying with Article 24(2) of DSA and the methods used for calculating the monthly active recipients of the service pursuant to Article 24(2) of the DSA do not correspond with the Company’s methods used to calculate our daily active users and the geographic breakdown regarding such users. Roblox does not otherwise publish EU user metrics.
