      Depending on the Roblox feature (e.g. features like Avatar Shop versus Experience Search), Roblox uses different factors to provide Users and Creators the most relevant search results and recommendations. The category of factors and relative importance applied to each of them varies depending on the applicable search or recommendation feature. Furthermore, for some features, Roblox provides Users and Creators the option to modify the order of results or recommendations that are presented, which can be found in close proximity to the search or recommendation feature.

      User Recommendations
     </h2>
     <p>
      When presenting search results for User Search and recommendations for Friends, we consider User’s account information, activity, and connections. This information helps Users find existing friends and connections with similar interests.
     </p>
     <p>
      When presenting search results for Experiences, we consider User’s account information, activities, relevance to the search and Experience content, quality, performance, and popularity. Overall popularity indicates there is a high chance other Users will like the experience. When recommending Experiences, we consider User’s account information, activities, and connections, as well as Experience content, quality, performance, and popularity. User’s activity indicates certain interests, and based on the popularity, there is a very high chance that User will like the experience as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      When presenting search results for the Avatar Shop, we consider relevance to the search and item popularity. Overall popularity indicates there is a high chance other Users will like the item. Roblox provides Users the option to modify the filters and signals which are used for the ranking of Avatar Shop search results. These options can be found on the left sidebar within the Avatar Shop. When recommending items in the Avatar Shop, we consider the User's account information and activity, which indicate certain interests and helps surface interesting new items to the User.

      Creator Recommendations
     </h2>
     <p>
      The Creator Marketplace is a collection of available assets that Creators can use to create experiences. When Creators search for assets, they have the option to modify the filters and signals which are used for the ranking of search results. These options can be found using the toggle icon next to the title, which reveals a left sidebar.
     </p>
     <p>
      When presenting search results in the Creator Marketplace, we consider signals like popularity, relevance, Creator account information, Creator activity, and, where relevant, asset information. Overall popularity and relevance indicate there is a high chance other Creators will use the asset. Creator account information, Creator activity, and asset information indicate the quality of the assets that will be more likely to be used by others in their experiences and are helpful to create matching results in the search. When making recommendations in the Creator Marketplace we consider the popularity of an asset.
