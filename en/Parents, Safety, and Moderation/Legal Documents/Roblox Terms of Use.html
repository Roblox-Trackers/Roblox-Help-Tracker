              Roblox’s liability is unlimited for damages arising out of death, injury to body or health based on a breach conducted by a legal representative or designated agent of Roblox, as well as for damages that arouse from the lack of a guaranteed characteristic or in case of fraudulent intent.

              In case of a slight negligent breach of a contractual core duty Roblox shall, except in the cases set out in this Section 8A, B and D of this Appendix C, only be liable to the amount of the typically foreseeable damage. Contractual core duties abstractly are such duties whose accomplishment enables proper fulfilment of the contract in the first place and whose fulfilment a contractual party regularly may rely on.

              Liability pursuant to mandatory applicable law remains unaffected.
