      By clicking “Agree”, you, the Creator, confirm your acceptance of this Music Upload License Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Roblox Corporation (“Roblox”) for use on our interactive gaming platform (the “Platform”). Creator hereby agrees as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       Creator represents and warrants to Roblox that, Creator: (a) either owns all right, title and interest in and to, or has obtained and paid for, and will continue to maintain and pay for, all licenses (including public performance licenses) that are required for all sound recordings (including corresponding artist name(s) and track title(s)) and musical works (collectively, the “Music”) to be uploaded, published and distributed on the Platform and (b) has ensured and confirmed that Roblox shall not be responsible for the payment of royalties, fees or any other compensation to any third party, including, without limitation, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record label or recording artist), a musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher or songwriter), a musical works performing rights organization (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc.), a sound recording performing rights organization (e.g., SoundExchange), any unions or guilds, and any engineers, producers or other royalty participants involved in the creation of, or otherwise entitled to any compensation in connection with, the uploading, publishing, distribution, reproduction, synchronization, public performance or communication to the public of any of the Music on the Platform. Creator agrees to withdraw any Music from availability on the Platform on or before the expiration or termination of the underlying license(s) required hereunder.
      </li>
      <li>
       Creator hereby grant to Roblox a perpetual, worldwide license to: (a) transmit, reproduce, communicate to the public, and publicly perform, reproduce, synchronize and create derivative works from the Music on the Platform and in all distribution channels of the Platform, (b) feature the artist name(s), writer name(s), and track title(s)) of the Music on the Platform, (c) digitally transcode, make copies of, reproduce and otherwise process the Music to the extent necessary to facilitate any of the foregoing rights, (d) sublicense any of the foregoing rights to developers and users of the Platform for the purposes of featuring the Music in games, experiences, virtual merchandise on the Platform and in connection with the promotion thereof, and (e) use the Music and related content for promotional purposes. You hereby grant users who purchase products containing Music a perpetual license for the use of such product.
      </li>
      <li>
       Creator understands and agrees that the Music must at all times conform to Roblox’s community standards and guidelines that are part of the Roblox Legal Terms (e.g., no profanity, drug or explicitly sexual references) and that Roblox is under no obligation to publish any Music that Roblox determines may violate such standards or guidelines or any other Roblox policy.
      </li>
      <li>
       Roblox shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Platform, any Roblox services and any Roblox trademarks and logos, including but not limited to, all rights of patent, copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights and any enhancements or modifications thereto. Roblox reserves all rights to directly monetize the Platform in any manner.
      </li>
      <li>
       Creator agrees to indemnify and hold Roblox and its affiliates and subsidiaries harmless from any claims related to the exercise of Roblox’s rights hereunder with respect to all or a part of the Music on the Platform, including, without limitation, any claims or demands that the Music or any part thereof violates or infringes the rights of any third party or that Roblox owes any royalties, fees or any other compensation to any third party with respect to the exercise of its rights with respect to the Music.
      </li>
      <li>
       At any time upon Roblox’s request, and subject to any actual confidentiality obligations that may exist in any license agreements between Creator and the licensor(s) of the sound recordings and musical works contained within the Music, Creator will email true and correct copies of the applicable licenses required to publish the sound recordings and musical works contained within the Music on the Platform to: songclearance@roblox.com (or such other email address as Roblox may designate). Roblox’s receipt or review of such licenses will not constitute a waiver of any of Creator’s obligations to provide all rights required for the Music to be published on the Platform as described herein.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Any Disputes that may arise in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved in accordance with Section 11 of the Roblox Terms of Use.
