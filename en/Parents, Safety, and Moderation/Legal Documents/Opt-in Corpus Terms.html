     <p>
      Thank you for your interest in contributing your scripts (your “Contributions”) to enhance Roblox’s AI model and to build the Luau Dataset (together, the “Contribution Programs”). In order to opt-in to either of these programs, YOU MUST ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THE TERMS BELOW APPLICABLE TO EACH CONTRIBUTION PROGRAM.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Terms Applicable to Both Contribution Programs
     </h2>
     <p>
      You are responsible for ensuring that all of your Contributions comply with the Roblox Terms of Use (the “Terms”) including the Roblox Community Standards, and you understand and acknowledge that you and your Contributions are subject to and governed by the Terms, including those set forth and restated herein. While Roblox will filter Contributions for sensitive data, your Contributions remain your responsibility so you must review and restrict your Contributions for any data and/or content you should not or do not want to share.
     </p>
     <p>
      You hereby grant to Roblox a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right and license to host, use, copy, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, run, create derivative works of, distribute, and publicly perform or display, without attribution, your Contributions and derivative works thereof throughout the world. As to Roblox, you waive any moral rights to your Contributions and agree not to assert them against Roblox.
     </p>
     <p>
      You represent and warrant that (i) you own or otherwise control all the rights in/to your Contributions; and (ii) your Contributions and your submission of your Contributions are not fraudulent or deceptive, in any way, and do not violate the Terms, any applicable laws, or the rights of any third party, including intellectual property, privacy, and publicity, and will not cause injury to any person or entity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Your submission of Contributions is solely at your own risk and volition. Roblox does not guarantee or warrant any particular outcome or result from your submission of Contributions and expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Contribution Programs. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy that you may have against Roblox regarding your Contributions.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Additional Terms Applicable to the Luau Dataset Contribution Programs
     </h2>
     <p>
      You acknowledge and agree that your Contributions will be included in the Luau Dataset which may be submitted under a permissive open source license to third parties (including those that may use the Luau Dataset to train their models) and may be made publicly available, and that the terms conditions and policies of such third parties shall govern the submission, acceptance, and use of the Luau Dataset, including your Contributions. You acknowledge and agree that to the extent the Luau Dataset is submitted to third parties, Roblox will not control the Luau Dataset including your Contributions, Roblox will not responsible for or liable to you for your Contributions, and (unlike Contributions to Roblox’s AI model from which you may opt-out) you will not be able to remove your Contributions from the Luau Dataset.
