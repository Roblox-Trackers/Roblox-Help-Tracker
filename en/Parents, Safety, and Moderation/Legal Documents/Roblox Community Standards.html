              Independent Advertisement Publishing
             </summary>
             Instead of using Roblox Immersive Ads, developers may independently publish advertising content in their experience(s). In these cases, the developer of the experience must directly upload and control delivery of the advertising content and remains responsible for such content. When independently publishing advertisements, developers must follow the rules outlined below, as well as all Roblox rules (including the Terms of Use,
             <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/13722260778260" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
              Advertising Standards
             </a>
             , and all other Community Standards) and applicable laws and regulations. If your advertising content violates these rules, we may take action including removing the content, suspending the experience or suspending the account.
             <ul>
              <li>
               Developers must maintain full control of independent advertisement publishing. If a developer shows independent ads in their experience, that experience may not make programmatic calls to third-party advertising services.
              </li>

              </li>
              <li>
               Developers are prohibited from showing advertising content to users under the age of 13. To accomplish this, developers must use Roblox tools such as the AreAdsAllowed boolean in
               <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PolicyService" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
                PolicyService API

               <br/>
               Note: Applying a 13+ Experience Guideline does not hide ad content from users under the age of 13. All ad content must be hidden using the PolicyService API.
              </li>
              <li>
               Developers must clearly and prominently disclose to users when content is an advertisement using simple and understandable language. Reference to the name of an advertiser alone is insufficient. Examples of acceptable disclosure language include “ad,” “paid,” or “sponsored.” The disclosure should be in or near the advertising content and be presented in a way that is likely to be noticed and understood by users.
              </li>
              <li>
               Developers may not mislead users into thinking that they are engaging with Roblox served Ads.
              </li>
              <li>
               Developers may not reuse or repurpose Roblox Immersive Ad content.
              </li>
              <li>
               Advertisements cannot falsely represent the content being advertised to encourage user engagement (e.g., offer free Robux).
