       Licensed Music
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      As a benefit to our community, Roblox has signed a license agreement with APM Music, one of the worldâ€™s leading production music libraries ("APM"). The license provides users with access to hundreds of thousands of music tracks ("
      <a href="/hc/articles/360000927163" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       Licensed Music
      </a>
      ") for use in their games on Roblox. We are publishing this article because we want to explain how, subject to certain conditions being met, the license generally allows developers and users to post videos of those games on social media, including YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, Facebook and blogs. This article is not legal advice and does not summarize all of the terms of the license with APM, but we hope that it will help answer most of the questions you may have about posting videos of Roblox games on social media, including some of the things you can do if APM places a claim or sends a takedown notice to YouTube or another social channel related to your video.

       Am I allowed to use the Licensed Music in Roblox games in my videos and live streams?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Roblox users and devs may create video captures of games/experiences with Licensed Music and post or publish those videos on any social media, such as YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, Instagram or Facebook (the "Video Capture"), provided your videos are otherwise compliant with the provisions of such social media channels and platforms. Licensed Music may only be synchronized with the Roblox game content featured on the Video Capture. Also, you may not download the Licensed Music as a separate file to your computer or use it any videos other than gameplay videos on the Roblox platform. One other thing to remember: your use of Licensed Music is at all times subject to the
      <a href="/hc/articles/115004647846" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       Roblox Terms of Use
      </a>
      . Under the license from APM, you are only permitted to promote the gameplay within your Video Capture. You are not allowed to use the Video Capture in a film, TV show, commercial or series, a separate video game off the Roblox platform or for placement in merchandise.

       Am I allowed to post videos of Roblox gameplay that contain Licensed Music on Social Media Video Platforms?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Users may post Video Captures containing Licensed Music on social media video platforms including Twitch, Twitter and others, provided you otherwise comply with all of the terms of such social media video platforms. Roblox does not endorse any specific video platform.

      <strong>
       Am I allowed to monetize videos of Roblox gameplay that contain Licensed Music on YouTube?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Yes. Roblox users may generate revenue through appropriate advertisements placed on Video Captures containing Licensed Music, including pre-roll ads, ad breaks, and sponsor ad overlays on YouTube. They may also generate revenues through solicitation of personal donations or by offering subscription-based or paid transactional video content. Please note that YouTube may have its own rules about generating revenue.

       How do I dispute a copyright claim or takedown notice of my Roblox video or live stream?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If your use of the Licensed Music complies with the conditions described above (and does not contain content that APM considers to be objectionable) and you receive a copyright claim or takedown notice from APM Music or any of its copyright management partners (for example, AdRev), you may wish to dispute the claim or file a counter notice in accordance with the procedures on the applicable social media channel. In such cases, and as part of your statement to the claimant, you may mention that the track was licensed for use in the video from APM Music, through Roblox, and you can also include a link to this article. Roblox is not able to assist you with any takedown requests acted on by any social media channel or other third party and does not guarantee that you will be successful in defending any claim or takedown notice.
