       Q: Will parents/guardians be notified when the monthly spending limit has been reached?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: No, parents/guardians will not get an email notification unless they elect to receive email notifications from Roblox on all spend activity (make sure to add your email to the user account under “Account Info” in settings).

      <strong>
       Q: How will parents/guardians be notified of their child’s spending on Roblox?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: Parents/guardians can set spend notifications to either send an email when their child is exceeding a high risk threshold per calendar month or send an email for all amounts spent on the account. Parents/guardians can also choose to disable all notifications if they prefer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Q: Will accounts without a spending limit still receive notifications for high-risk transactions?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: Yes. By default parents/guardians will get an email notification. If notifications are turned off then no email will be sent.
