      This setting in the Parental Controls tab limits the amount of spending permitted on the under 13-year-old user’s account in all the countries except South Korea where it applies to under 18-year-old user's account per calendar month. It gives parents/guardians increased control and visibility over their child’s spending.

      <em>
       Note: Spend settings controls and future changes will require both a parental/guardian email and a parent PIN on the user account for increased security.
