      What happens when Allowed Experiences are set?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Parents are able to select age-appropriate experiences by enabling Allowed Experiences. This will allow your child to only join experiences that match or are below the age recommendations set. Experiences above the age restriction enabled may be displayed in search results or advertised in the ads. However, the experiences will not be viewable. Users will receive a message stating the experience is unavailable due to the account restrictions settings.

      How is an Age Recommendation determined?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Robloxâ€™s age recommendations are grounded in child development research and informed by industry standards. To determine which audiences an experience is generally suitable for, we examined global industry standards and consulted child development experts.
