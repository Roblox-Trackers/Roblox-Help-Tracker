      Roblox will not teach you to hack. Hacking experiences or compromising accounts is a violation of our
      <a href="/hc/articles/115004647846" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       Terms of Use
      </a>
      . This type of behavior does not show the values of Roblox nor the Roblox community experience. Any account caught hacking experiences or accessing accounts they don’t own will be moderated, including possible account deletion.

      Sometimes others will tell you they know how to “hack”. You may also see videos claiming to have a trick or secret that can give free Robux, membership, or currency. However, these tricks are often ways to give someone else access to your account or bad files known as "keyloggers," which record everything you type -- including your password information. This will allow someone other than you to access your account. It’s best if you do not believe any "hacks" that you hear about from other players or see in videos. Review
