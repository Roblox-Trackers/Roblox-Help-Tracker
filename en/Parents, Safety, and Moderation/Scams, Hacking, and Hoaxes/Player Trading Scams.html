      Roblox cannot enforce deals made between players outside our official features. There are a couple of official ways to transfer items or Robux between accounts. All other methods are un-official and should be treated as suspicious. The official systems are the
      <strong>
       Trade
      </strong>
      feature, and the
      <strong>
       Selling
      </strong>
      features (on clothing, experience passes, and developer products). If you made a deal with another player and they backed out we are not able to reverse it or return your items or currency.

      What are considered "deals"?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Examples of suspicious deals include the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Using the official systems to pay for accounts, real world money, or groups
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Lending your account or items out or letting a player borrow them
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Making deals where one of the sides has to go first and trust the other person
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Giving your account or item to a another person to sell or trade for you
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The above are generally attempts to scam items or Robux off of players.Â If you think a trade is a bad idea, it probably is, and you shouldn't do it.

      What should I do if I see someone scamming?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      Make sure to use the Report Abuse buttons located throughout the site to report anyone who is scamming. It's the best way to help prevent this from happening in the future.
