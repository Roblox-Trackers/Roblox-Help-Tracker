         These Terms and Conditions (this “Agreement”) describe the terms and conditions that apply to (1) Roblox-branded gift cards denominated in Australian Dollars, including plastic cards and digital gift cards (“Gift Cards”); and (2) Roblox account credits denominated in Australian Dollars (“Credits”). Gift Cards and Credits shall be collectively referred to herein as “Cards.” This Agreement is between you and Roblox Prepaid Company, LLC (“Issuer”). By purchasing, accepting, using or redeeming Gift Cards, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree with this Agreement, do not purchase, accept, use or redeem Gift Cards.

            Gift Cards are issued by Issuer. Issuer is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Gift Card and the Gift Card programs. Issuer is the sole legal obligor to you; provided, however, that Issuer may assign its obligations with respect to the Cards at any time, in which case such assignee shall become the Issuer and sole legal obligor. Roblox Corporation (“Roblox”) and its affiliates and related entities (other than Issuer) bear no responsibility or liability for any Gift Cards, and to the extent permitted by law you hereby knowingly release Roblox and its affiliates and related entities (other than Issuer) from any and all liability or claims of any nature whatsoever arising in connection with any Gift Card, except to the extent that that liability or claim was caused or contributed to by the act or omission of Roblox, its affiliates and/or related entities.

To redeem a Gift Card, you must be over 18 years old or obtain consent from a parent or guardian, have Internet access, login or register to create a Roblox account, and accept the then-current version of the Roblox Terms of Use or have your parent or guardian accept them if you are under 18 years old.

            You must acknowledge and agree that the value stated on the face of your Gift Card will redeem for the value of Credits in your local currency. You can only redeem a Gift Card that is denominated in the same currency as the country where your account is registered. In other words, you cannot redeem a Gift Card, which is denominated in United States Dollars, to a Roblox account that is denominated in another currency, such as Euros. If you have moved and would like to change the denomination of your Roblox account to a different currency, please contact us at

            . Gift Cards are not debit or credit cards. Gift Cards have no cash value, are not refundable or reloadable and may not be redeemed for cash (except as required by law). Gift Cards cannot be resold. Gift Cards must be redeemed in full and cannot be partially redeemed.

            When you redeem a Gift Card, you will receive the equivalent amount of Credits in Australian Dollars in your Roblox account. For example, a AU$100 Gift Card will be redeemed for AU$100 in Credits. Credits may be redeemed only for Robux (Roblox’s in-game currency issued by Roblox) or a Premium Subscription to Roblox. A Roblox Premium Subscription is a monthly subscription program where you receive a specified number of Robux per month, as well as certain other benefits, in exchange for a monthly fee. You can find more information about Roblox’s Premium Subscription at
            <a href="https://www.roblox.com/premium/membership" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
             https://www.roblox.com/premium/membership
            </a>
            . To redeem Credits, you must be over 18 years old or obtain consent from a parent or guardian. Availability and pricing of Robux and Premium Subscriptions are subject to change (current pricing information can be found at

            ). Credits have no cash value, are not refundable or transferable and may not be redeemed for cash (except as required by law). Note: Prior to April 24, 2023, the value stated on the face of your Gift Card was redeemable for Credits denominated in U.S. Dollars, regardless of the denomination of your Roblox account. From April 24, 2023, customers will only be able to redeem Credits in their local currency (meaning that for example, an Australian customer will no longer be able to redeem Credits in US dollars).

The selection of which free virtual item and free bonus item you receive is entirely within the discretion of Issuer and its affiliates.
