         These Terms and Conditions (this “Agreement”) describe the terms and conditions that apply to (1) Roblox-branded gift cards denominated in South African rand, including plastic cards and digital gift cards (“Gift Cards”); and (2) Roblox account credits denominated in United States Dollars (“Credits”). Gift Cards and Credits shall be collectively referred to herein as “Cards.” This Agreement is between you and Roblox Prepaid Company, LLC (“Issuer”). By purchasing, accepting, using or redeeming Cards, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree with this Agreement, do not purchase, accept, use or redeem Cards.

         <strong>
          IMPORTANT: This Agreement includes resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.

            Cards are issued by Issuer. Issuer is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Card and the Card programs. Issuer is the sole legal obligor to you; provided, however, that Issuer may assign its obligations with respect to the Cards at any time, in which case such assignee shall become the Issuer and sole legal obligor. Roblox Corporation (“Roblox”) and its affiliates and related entities (other than Issuer) bear no responsibility or liability for any Cards, and you hereby knowingly release Roblox and its affiliates and related entities (other than Issuer) from any and all liability or claims of any nature whatsoever arising in connection with any Card. This provision is without prejudice to absolute rights provided for in national consumer legislation.

             https://www.roblox.com/giftcards
            </a>
            . Gift Cards are not valid and will not be honored if obtained from unauthorized sellers, resellers or distributors, including through Internet auction sites. Gift Cards are redeemable only for purchases of Credits at

             https://www.roblox.com
            </a>
            . To redeem a Gift Card, you must be over 18 years old or obtain consent from a parent or guardian, have Internet access, login or register to create a Roblox account, and accept the then-current version of the Roblox Terms of Use or have your parent or guardian accept them if you are under 18 years old. The Terms of Use include User Terms, Creator Terms, a Privacy Policy and various other terms, which are subject to change from time to time, and are available at

            . You must also acknowledge and agree that the value stated on the face of your Gift Card will redeem for the value of Credits in your local currency. You can only redeem a Gift Card that is denominated in the same currency as the country where your account is registered. In other words, you cannot redeem a Gift Card, which is denominated in South African rand, to a Roblox account that is denominated in another currency, such as Euros. If you have moved and would like to change the denomination of your Roblox account to a different currency, please contact us at

            . Gift Cards are not debit or credit cards. Gift Cards have no cash value, are not refundable or reloadable and may not be redeemed for cash (except as required by law). Gift Cards cannot be resold. Gift Cards must be redeemed in full and cannot be partially redeemed.

            When you redeem a Gift Card, you will receive the equivalent amount of Credits in South African rand in your Roblox account. For example, a $100 Gift Card will be redeemed for $100 in Credits. Credits may be redeemed only for Robux (Roblox’s in-game currency issued by Roblox) or a Premium Subscription to Roblox. A Roblox Premium Subscription is a monthly subscription program where you receive a specified number of Robux per month, as well as certain other benefits, in exchange for a monthly fee. You can find more information about Roblox’s Premium Subscription at

            . To redeem Credits, you must be over 18 years old or obtain consent from a parent or guardian. Availability and pricing of Robux and Premium Subscriptions are subject to change (current pricing information can be found at

            ). Credits have no cash value, are not refundable or transferable and may not be redeemed for cash (except as required by law). Note: Prior to April 24, 2023, Gift Cards denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars were redeemable for Credits denominated in U.S. Dollars. As of such date, all such Credits were converted from U.S. Dollars to the currency of your home country.

            <strong>
             Please read this section carefully. It affects legal rights that you may otherwise have and requires individual final and binding arbitration of most disputes instead of resolution in court.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Arbitration is the submission of a dispute to a neutral arbitrator, instead of a judge or jury, for a final and binding decision, known as an “award.” Arbitration provides for more limited discovery than in an action filed in court, is subject to limited review by courts, and the result is confidential. Each party has an opportunity to present evidence to the arbitrator in writing or through witnesses. An arbitrator can only award the same damages and relief that a court can award under the law and must honor the terms and conditions in this Agreement.

           <p>
            <strong>
             In this Section, the term “related third parties” includes your and Issuer’s respective affiliates, subsidiaries, parent companies, predecessors, successors, assigns, as well as your, Issuer’s, and these entities' respective employees and agents.

           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             You and Issuer agree that any dispute, whether at law or equity, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the previous version(s) of this Agreement or your purchase or use of the Cards, including disputes involving related third parties, regardless of the date of accrual of such dispute, including but not limited to the arbitrability of any dispute and the interpretation, enforceability, validity and/or the scope of this arbitration agreement, shall be resolved in its entirety by individual (not classwide or collective) binding arbitration, except that you or Issuer may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court. This is without prejudice to the right to seek redress before a consumer tribunal or court provided in national consumer legislation.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             You and Issuer agree that any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis and that class, mass, consolidated or combined actions or arbitrations or proceedings as a private attorney general are not permitted. You and Issuer agree that the arbitrator may award monetary declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             You and Issuer both waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any claims to recover punitive or exemplary damages.

           <p>
            <strong>
             This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. This agreement to arbitrate extends to claims that you assert against other parties, including without limit claims against related third parties, such as Issuer’s affiliates including but not limited to Roblox.

           <p>
            <strong>
             The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the substantive law applicable to any arbitration, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.

           <p>

             This agreement to arbitrate shall survive termination of this Agreement. If it is decided that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this arbitration agreement’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if any part of this agreement to arbitrate is deemed invalid or inapplicable, the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate shall still be considered valid and enforceable.

             You and Issuer agree that if Issuer makes any amendment to this Arbitration Agreement in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding between You and the Issuer (and any related third parties) prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Arbitration Agreement that have arisen or may arise between you and Issuer (or related third parties).

           <p>
            Arbitration shall be conducted by JAMS in accordance with its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”). The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at http://www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must serve Issuer’s registered agent for service of process. Contact information for Issuer’s registered agent is available on the California Secretary of State Business Search website located at
            <a href="https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/search/business" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
             https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/search/business

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that for claims of less than $1,000, you will be obligated to pay $25 and Issuer will pay all other administrative costs and fees. In addition, for claims of less than $1,000, Issuer will reimburse you for the $25 fee if the arbitrator rules in your favor. Reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses will be awarded only to the extent such allocation or award is available under applicable law.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any arbitration will take place in or near the county where claimant resides and will be determined by a single arbitrator; provided, however, that upon request by either party, the arbitration shall be conducted via telephone to the extent permitted by the JAMS Rules.
           </p>
           <p>
            The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application related to the arbitration, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
           </p>
           <p>
            The arbitrator(s) will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
