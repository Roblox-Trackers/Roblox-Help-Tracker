      Roblox was founded in 2004. The founders were David Baszucki and Erik Cassel. The main headquarters are located in San Mateo, California.

      The first couple hundred builders of Roblox were all developers, investors, testers, and friends of the founders. It's hard to say who the first player of Roblox was since some of those early accounts are still active.
