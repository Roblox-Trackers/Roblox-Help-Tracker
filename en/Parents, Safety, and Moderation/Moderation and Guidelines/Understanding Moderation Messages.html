        "Scamming is a violation of the Terms of Service. Do not continue to scam on Roblox."
       </strong>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Roblox has determined from the evidence provided to them that you were attempting to scam another player or group of players.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>

         An exploit is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic.

       </strong>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Roblox cannot guarantee a payout by a game to a player. Promising a payout of Robux to anyone under any pretense is considered a scam.

        <li>

     <ul>
      <li>
       <strong>
        My moderation message does not appear on the list above.
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Not all moderation fit into the above categories. Sometimes the moderator will customize the message for the situation.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        I am not sure what my moderation means or my moderation was wrong.
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In these cases you can appeal your account moderation by following
       <a href="/hc/articles/360000245263" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
        these steps
       </a>
       . Make sure you include your username and your question.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        I got a warning, am I on the road to deletion?
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Not likely, Roblox only deletes accounts for the most serious violations or people who are maliciously acting on our community.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Will this impact my ability to DevEx?
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Roblox does not pre-approve or deny anyone for DevEx, but in most cases no. We always look at intent and effect when deciding on DevEx.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Do you use AI for your moderation?
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Roblox uses AI to pre-screen content such as text, images, and audio but only human moderators will take action on accounts. Roblox employs a team of over 400 human moderators to review reports and take action on accounts.
      </li>
     </ul>
