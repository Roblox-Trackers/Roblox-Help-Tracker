      There are a ton of awesome games, TV shows, and movies out there that you might want to put in your content. However, keep in mind this is only allowed on Roblox if you have written permission from its copyright owner.

      When do I need permission?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      In order to use someone else's material, you must always have written permission. This includes anything you can see or hear such as:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Textures
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Music
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Characters
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Artwork
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Names
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Brands/Logos
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Products
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      This also includes anything else that can be covered by copyright law.
     </p>

     </p>
     <h1>
      What happens if I don't have permission?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If you use someone else's creation without first getting approval, and the copyright owner contacts us to let us know, the material will need to be removed and the account may be moderated.
     </p>

      What about fan art?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If you have created your own artwork featuring a product or character, this is usually considered okay. The art will need to be created entirely from scratch and you should not use the original creations within your work.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      For example - a drawing you sat down and drew of a movie villain is acceptable but a wallpaper that includes a copy and pasted version of the movie's original artwork is not.
