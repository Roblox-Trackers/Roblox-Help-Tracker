      The following are important to keep in mind with custom experience rules:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Such rules are allowed as long as they don't conflict with the
       <a href="/hc/articles/203313410" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
        Roblox Community Standards
       </a>
      </li>
      <li>
       It is optional for developers to make these rules
      </li>
      <li>
       Breaking these rules is not able to be reported with our Report Abuse system
      </li>
      <li>
       The developer must make their own systems to handle the breaking of their custom rules
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Please be aware that excessively mean-spirited rules can fall into the realm of harassment, which is not allowed on Roblox. In such situations, please utilize our
