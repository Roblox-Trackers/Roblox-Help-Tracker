      The Roblox Community is made up of players and developers of all ages. We work hard to create a safe and fun environment for all of our community. To aid in this, we provide our players and their parents with numerous controls and safety features.

      Chat &amp; Privacy
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      All chat on Roblox is filtered to prevent inappropriate content and personally identifiable information from being visible on the site. Players have different safety settings and experiences based on their age.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Players age 12 and younger have their posts and chats filtered both for inappropriate content and to prevent personal information from being posted. Players age 13 and older have the ability to say more words and phrases than younger players. This filtering system covers all areas of communication on Roblox, public and private.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The account's age group is displayed in the upper-right corner of the browser as either
      <strong>
       13+
      </strong>
      or
      <strong>
       &lt;13
      </strong>
      . This is also displayed while in games. An account's age group is not displayed to other players.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Account owners have the ability to limit or disable who can chat with them, both in-app or in-game, who can send them messages, and who can follow them into games or invite them to private servers.

        <br/>
       </strong>
       This feature allows parents to limit the types games the child can play, and the account's ability to chat. Enabling Account Restrictions will lock an account's Contact Settings so that no one can send messages, chat in-app or in-game with the child. Account Restrictions will also limit play to games that are on a pre-approved list that has been verified by Roblox.

       <br/>
       Parents have the option to add a four-digit PIN to lock the account settings. Once a PIN is added, it will be needed to make any changes to the account settings. This feature protects your password, email address, and privacy settings.

       <br/>
       This feature makes it so no one else can login to the account even if they know the password. When your child logs in from a new device Roblox will send you a code via email. The player can not log in without that code. Since only you have access to your email account, only you will be able to get the security code.
