      How we protect our Roblox community:
     </h2>
     <p>
      Roblox’s vision is to connect billions of people through shared experiences in the Metaverse. Safety and civility are foundational to this vision and creating a platform where everyone feels welcome. That’s why we’ve always made it a key priority to ensure our community members can connect, create, and come together in a space that is welcoming, safe, inclusive and respectful. We’ve spent over a decade building a stringent safety system and policies that we are proud of and that we are continuously evolving as our community grows.
     </p>
     <h2>
      Our Policies
     </h2>
     <p>
      Our
      <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       <strong>
        Community Standards
       </strong>
      </a>
      set clear expectations for how to behave on Roblox. They require that everyone treat each other with civility and respect and help keep everyone safe by prohibiting content and behavior that may be inappropriate or harmful. Our Trust and Safety team uses these Standards to moderate content and respond to abuse reports from users. If any users are found to be violating these standards, they may be suspended or removed from the platform. In some cases, Roblox also works proactively with authorities to report cases of violent threats, child endangerment, or other serious real world harm. We update our Community Standards periodically as the needs of our community and the product change.

     <h2>
      Our Teams &amp; Tools
     </h2>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Trust &amp; Safety team
      </strong>
      : We have a large, expertly trained team with thousands of members dedicated to protecting our users and monitoring 24/7 for inappropriate content. Our Trust &amp; Safety team takes swift action (typically within minutes) to address any content or behavior that violates our

      .
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Proactive safety review of uploaded assets
      </strong>
      : We conduct a safety review of every uploaded image, audio, and video file, using a combination of review by a large team of human moderators and machine detection before these assets become available on our platform for our community to utilize in their creations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Parental Controls
      </strong>
      : We offer
      <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/parents/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       parental controls
      </a>
      and features such as "

       limit chat
      </a>
      to a curated list of contacts for their kids’ accounts, or turn it off altogether. They can also choose to lock their kid’s "Contact Settings" so they cannot be changed. Some developers also offer
      <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2020/07/updates-to-private-servers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       private servers
      </a>
      (for free or for a small fee, depending on the developer) so that our community members can enjoy experiences with only their friends and people they choose to be included in the server. We have our opt-in
      <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/09/introducing-age-verification/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       Age Verification
      </a>
      for anyone 13 years of age or older with a government-issued ID—this service helps enable age-appropriate experiences and capabilities for verified users, and lets them express themselves in a safe and respectful way. Looking forward, we are also developing content ratings to match users with content that’s appropriate for their age, giving parents even more control over how their children interact with Roblox.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Reporting
      </strong>
      : We actively encourage our users to report any activity or content they feel uncomfortable or concerned about. Users can easily mute or block players that they come across in games and report inappropriate content/behavior using our
      <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203312410" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       Report Abuse
      </a>
      system. When a user submits a report about any rule violations, our safety team assesses complaints deemed actionable to ensure appropriate action is taken as quickly as possible. That action can include temporary suspension, account or content removal, or proactive reporting to authorities.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Chat filtering
      </strong>
      : We filter all text chat on the platform to block inappropriate content, such as discriminatory speech, bullying, extremism, violence, sexual content, etc., as well as personal information and instructions on how to move off the platform. We update our filters continuously, multiple times a day. For users under 13, our filters are even stricter and include any potentially identifiable personal information, slang, etc. In order for us to maintain a safe platform and prevent inappropriate content in violation of our policies, users are also not able to exchange images or videos via chat or one-to-one user interactions on Roblox.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Privacy
      </strong>
      : We do not share any personal data with third parties for users under 13 beyond what is permitted by COPPA, and overall, we limit data collection to what’s necessary and acceptable under our strict privacy policy in order to run a safe and efficient platform. We are COPPA certified by kidSAFE (we are a member of their
      <a href="https://www.kidsafeseal.com/aboutourprogram.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
