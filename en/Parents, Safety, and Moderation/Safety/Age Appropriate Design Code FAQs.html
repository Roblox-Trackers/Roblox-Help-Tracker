        How Does Roblox’s Text Filtering System Keep Kids Safe?
       </strong>
       <p>
        Roblox goes above and beyond to foster an environment where people of any age can create, play, learn, and imagine safely. We’ve kept children’s privacy and safety top-of-mind when designing our platform, especially through the implementation of advanced text filters that block inappropriate language or other unsafe content. Specifically, this text filter will automatically block swear words, personally-identifiable information (like an address or phone number), words associated with bullying and harassment, and any unrecognized text.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, if a child tries to share their address, our chat filter will prevent the message from sending. The child will see their blocked message show up as a series of “hash” marks (####) and receive a warning that their message was not sent. The other user(s) will never know that the child attempted to send a message. We further restrict access to social media links for young children, as well as mobile notifications (pop-ups).

        How Do I Control Who Can Chat with My Child?
       </strong>
       <p>
        If your child is under 13, we make it extremely difficult for strangers on Roblox to contact them. You can further restrict your child’s ability to chat with others on Roblox by doing the following:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Click the gear icon to navigate to “Settings”
        </li>
        <li>
         Select the “Privacy” tab
        </li>
        <li>
         Select “Off” under “Contact Settings”
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Here’s what the different options for controlling contact with your child on Roblox mean:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         “Who can message me” controls who can send a message to your child’s “Messages” Inbox.
        </li>
        <li>
         “Who can chat with me in-app” controls who can send your child a chat message when they’re using the Roblox app or website. This setting also controls whether a user can post on Group walls.
        </li>
        <li>
         “Who can chat with me” controls which users can chat with your child in real time when they’re in an experience.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        If you have set up a parental code on your child’s Roblox account, these chat settings cannot be changed without that code. Note: while it is possible to turn off in-game chat, doing so may make Roblox less enjoyable, since many of our games are built around the ability to chat with fellow Robloxians.

        What is a Parental Code?
       </strong>
       <p>
        If your child has a Roblox account, you can set up a parental code that needs to be entered before that account’s privacy settings can be changed. Follow the instructions below to create a parental code:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Click the gear icon to navigate to “Settings”
        </li>
        <li>
         Select the “Security” tab
        </li>
        <li>
         Click on the tab next to “Account PIN is currently disabled”
         <br/>
         <img alt="Account_PIN.png" height="78" src="/hc/article_attachments/4406242795284/Account_PIN.png" width="402"/>
        </li>
        <li>
         If you have not yet done so, enter in and verify your email address.
         <br/>
         <img alt="Email_required_for_PIN.png" height="91" src="/hc/article_attachments/4406242794900/Email_required_for_PIN.png" width="198"/>
        </li>
        <li>
         Once you have followed the instructions to verify your email address, return to this page and click on the tab next to “Account PIN is currently disabled.” You will then be prompted to create a 4-digit PIN.
         <br/>
         <img alt="Create_PIN.png" height="175" src="/hc/article_attachments/4406242794644/Create_PIN.png" width="145"/>
        </li>
        <li>
         Your parental code is complete once you’ve entered your PIN and clicked “Add.” Your PIN will now be required before any account settings can be changed.
