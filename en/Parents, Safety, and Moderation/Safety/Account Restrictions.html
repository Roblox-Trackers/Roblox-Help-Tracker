      Roblox offers users of all ages the ability to socialize and play games with others in the community. There are multiple opportunities to chat with others, and various games that offer different experiences from Adventure to Combat to Role Playing, and more. We do allow games with some forms of cartoon violence, as long as they are not overly graphic or realistic. However, Roblox does offer a feature that allows parents to limit the ability to chat, and types of games their children can access.

      What happens when Account Restrictions are enabled?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Enabling Account Restrictions will lock an account's Contact Settings so that no other user can send messages, chat in-app or in-game, or find the account by its phone number. None of these Contact Settings can be individually adjusted when Account Restrictions are turned on.

      Account Restrictions will also limit play to only games that are on a pre-approved list that has been verified as appropriate by Roblox. These games may contain some mild cartoon combat, but the list is restricted to only games that are less violent and do not feature guns. To ensure the best experience for younger players, when determining which games to include on the restricted list, we use selective criteria which closely follows the Entertainment Software Rating Board ratings for users under the age of 13.

      Will my child be able to search for games that are not on the restricted list?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Accounts may still see games that are not on the restricted list in search results or advertised in the ads on the site when Account Restrictions are enabled. However, these games will not be playable. Users with Account Restrictions will see a message that the game is unavailable due to account restrictions settings.
