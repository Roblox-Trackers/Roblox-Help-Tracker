      All of the experiences on Roblox are user-generated, made by a network of talented creators from all over the world. As a collaborative platform, many of these creators look for others within the community so they can form teams and build new content together. One of the ways we’re focused on providing a safe place for creators to build and foster these connections is through our

      </a>
      platform.

     <h2>
      What users can do on Talent Hub
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Talent Hub is a place where creators can find other people to work with, hire someone for their team, or search for jobs related to their skills. Profiles will show a person’s Roblox username and avatar, their skill set, and if they’re open for work. Much like a normal resume, users can also link to their previous creations and share their education and relevant training and any other important information.

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Interested parties can message each other on the platform to explore whether they’re a good fit for a role. Some of these roles are paid employment, so it’s important to note that Roblox is not responsible for any disputes relating to this. We will support our community by helping users connect with the right people and by educating them on how to protect against bad actors. Anyone engaging in paid work must be legally entitled to do so and is responsible for making appropriate tax payments.

      Safety
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      As with all other Roblox services, we check to make sure all content on Talent Hub is appropriate. Nevertheless, we always encourage parents and guardians to talk with their kids and teens about their online activities—both in and outside of Roblox. Understanding how they use Talent Hub is an important part of that conversation. Plus, it’s a great way for them to show you their creations!

      Anyone that has a verified badge on their Talent Hub profile are users that Roblox knows and trusts. This allows parents and their children to know that we reasonably believe they’re a real person and that they are who they say they are. Parents can prevent their child from viewing any Talent Hub content posted by unverified creators by setting up an account PIN on the

      .
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Additionally, parents can outright block access to Talent Hub by turning on Account Restrictions in the parental controls, which can also be found on the
