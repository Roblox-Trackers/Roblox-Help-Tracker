      All the experiences within Roblox are user-generated, created by a talented network of developers from all over the world - your child may be one of them! As the Roblox platform is so collaborative, many of these developers look to collaborate with others on building these experiences.
     </p>
     <p>
      Keeping our community safe is our number one priority at Roblox, and providing a safe place for these developer interactions is another positive avenue to achieve that mission. To that end, Talent Hub - the platform to help create and foster connections between Roblox developers and those seeking their services - places the security and privacy of its users as the top priority.

      What users can do on Talent Hub
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Creators can find jobs on the Talent Hub specific to their skills, while developers and teams can find creators for their projects. Profiles will show a person’s Roblox username and avatar, along with their main skillset. Anyone actively searching for jobs will be listed as “open to work” on their profile. Much like a normal resume, users can link to their previous creations and share their education and relevant training, along with any other important information.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Interested parties can message each other on the platform to explore whether they are a good fit for a role. Some of these roles are paid employment, and it is important to note that Roblox is not responsible for any disputes relating to this. We will support our community by helping users connect with the right people, and by educating them on how to protect against bad actors. Anyone engaging in paid work must be legally entitled to do so and is responsible for making appropriate tax payments.

      Safety
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      As with all Roblox services, we moderate content to make sure it is appropriate and support creators on the Talent Hub to enjoy a safe, healthy, and positive experience while they are using the platform.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      We always encourage parents and guardians to talk with their kids and teens about what they do online and within the Roblox metaverse and understanding how they use the Talent Hub is a part of this conversation (and a great way for them to show you their creations).
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      On Talent Hub, creators who Roblox know and trust are marked as ‘Verified’. This allows parents and their children to know that we reasonably think they’re a real person. The parent can block their child from viewing any Talent Hub content posted by creators who are not ‘Verified’ by setting up an Account PIN which can be found on the

       Security page of Account Settings
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Additionally, parents can outright block access to the Talent Hub by turning on Account Restrictions in the parental controls which can be found on the
