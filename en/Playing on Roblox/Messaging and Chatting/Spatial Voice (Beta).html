      What is Spatial Voice (Beta)?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Spatial Voice (Beta) is a feature that allows users to engage in voice chat within spatial voice experiences on Roblox. As this feature is in beta testing, it is currently only available to eligible developers aged 13+. Eligible developers must enable the Spatial Voice (Beta) by agreeing to the use of their mic to collect and share their voice as part of this beta test.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Users who are not part of this beta test will have no change to their experience, and will not be able to hear or speak with other users via Spatial Voice (Beta) at this time. Please read the information below to find out when Spatial Voice (Beta) may be available for you in the future.
     </p>

      How do I enable or participate in Spatial Voice (Beta)?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      While Spatial Voice (Beta) is in its initial testing phase, eligible users will receive a Private Message (PM) on their Roblox account with information on how to participate in Spatial Voice (Beta). Initially, Spatial Voice (Beta) will only be available in the “Roblox Community Space” experience. Developers will eventually be able to enable Spatial Voice (Beta) in their own experiences. At that time, eligible users in the Spatial Voice (Beta) will receive a notification when they join an experience that has enabled voice chat.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">

       Roblox and our Customer Support team cannot add users by request. Please watch for future announcements to see when Spatial Voice may be available for you.

      How can I tell who has Spatial Voice (Beta)?

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      While Spatial Voice (Beta) is in its current testing phase, eligible users in an experience will see a microphone icon next to the user name and above the avatar of other users that have voice chat enabled. Users will not otherwise be able to see who does or does not have Spatial Voice (Beta).
