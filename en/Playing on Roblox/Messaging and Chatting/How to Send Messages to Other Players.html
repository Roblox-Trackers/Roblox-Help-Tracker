      If the person that you are trying to message has a Message button that is not clickable, then their privacy settings might not be set up to allow private messages at this time. Additionally, you will need to make sure your privacy settings would allow them to message you back. For example, if you only allow your friends to message you and you are trying to message someone who isn't your friend, the message button would not be able to be clicked.
