     </h2>
     <p>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       Chat with spatial voice Beta is a new feature that allows people to communicate in Roblox as naturally as they communicate in the physical world.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       Today, developers have the choice to integrate this technology into their experiences.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       Eligible, age-verified, age 13+ users can opt-in to use this feature by visiting their Settings page. They will then be able to use chat with spatial voice in any Roblox experience that supports it.
