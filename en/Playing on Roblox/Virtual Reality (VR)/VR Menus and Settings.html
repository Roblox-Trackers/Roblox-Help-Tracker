      Understanding the menus and settings in VR can help you get the most out of your experience.
     </p>
     <p>
      The menu splits into a bottom bar and side menu in VR.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <strong>
       Bottom Bar
      </strong>
      follows your view and can be collapsed to the bottom of the screen.
      <br/>
      It gives you access to the In-Game Menu, the Exit page and the Core UI toggles.
      <br/>
      The In-Game Menu has additional options for VR comfort settings - Comfort, Default, and Expert modes as well as Custom where you may individually turn the following settings on and off:
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>

     <p>
      <strong>
       VR Stepped Rotation Enabled

     <p>
      <strong>
       3rd Person Fixed Camera
