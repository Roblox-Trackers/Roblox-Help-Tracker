      The Roblox app will be coming to Meta Quest, with an Open Beta on Meta’s App Lab. The Open Beta is an opportunity for our developers to gather feedback from VR users who join their experiences. Meta Quest headset owners can install the Roblox app and enjoy experiences together with Roblox users from Xbox, iOS, Android, and desktop devices.

      Any experience that has been published for VR users will be available on Meta Quest. There will be thousands of experiences that work well in VR. The Open Beta is an opportunity for our developer community to test their experiences for VR and decide if they want to publish their experiences for VR. We expect as the Open Beta continues, there will be more experiences available for VR.

      No, users will not be able to rate experiences from within Meta Quest headset. We would like to give the developers a chance to optimize their experiences for VR before getting rated.
