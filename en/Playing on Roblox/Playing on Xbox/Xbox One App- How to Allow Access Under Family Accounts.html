      Roblox experiences are created by our community of players and developers, and require access to both online multiplayer experiences and user-created content.
     </p>
     <p>
      If your child is under a Family account on Xbox One, a few settings may require adjustment in order to ensure access to experiences on the Roblox app.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       To begin, log into theÂ main account that has control over the Family accounts
      </li>
      <li>
       After that, go to All Settings -&gt; Account -&gt; Family
      </li>
      <li>
       Once there, choose the child account for which you wish to allow access
      </li>
      <li>
       Next, go to Privacy &amp; Online Safety -&gt; Xbox Live privacy -&gt; View Details &amp; Customize
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Once on this page, you will need to make changes to settings is both "Communication &amp; multiplayer" and "Experience Content".
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Communication &amp; multiplayer
      </strong>
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       Select this section and locate, "You can join multiplayer experiences"
      </li>
      <li>
       In the pull-down menu, choose
       <strong>
        Allow
       </strong>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Experience Content
      </strong>
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       Select this section and locate, "You can see and share content"
      </li>
      <li>
       In the pull-down menu, choose
       <strong>
        Everybody
       </strong>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Once done, back all of the way out to the list of family members. If you have more than one child for whom you wish to grant access, repeat these steps for each child.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <em>
       *Note* If your child's "Access to content" is set below "Appropriate up to age 10", a pop-up window will appear requesting parent permission to access the Roblox app.
