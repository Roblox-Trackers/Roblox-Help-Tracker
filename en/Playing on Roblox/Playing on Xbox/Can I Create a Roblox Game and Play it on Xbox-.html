      How Can I Play my Games With Friends?
     </h1>
     <div class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If you want to simply play your original games with friends, you can use
      <strong>
       My Games
      </strong>
      , which is found to the far right of the
      <strong>
       Games
      </strong>
      tab.Â Setting up My Games is fast and simple. Any game published on the Roblox website will automatically appear on your Xbox account. Any updates published online will automatically sync with your My Games place on Xbox.
     </div>
     <div class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      From there, playing your game on Xbox with friends is just as easy to do. The owner of the place can create an Xbox party with their Xbox friends. After that, they can jump directly into the game with everyone in the party. Being social is at the core of what Roblox is all about and we hope everyone enjoys playing their own games on Xbox and sharing the experience with friends!
