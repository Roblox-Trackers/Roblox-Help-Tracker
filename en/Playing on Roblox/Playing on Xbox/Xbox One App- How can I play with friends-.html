      To play with your Roblox friends on Xbox, you can do the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       When both users simultaneously press
       <strong>
        Play
       </strong>
       on the same experience page, they will have more of a chance to play in the same server
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        In order to make sure you get into the same experience, the Xbox user must join first, then the user on the other platform may open your profile and click
        <strong>
         Join Experience
        </strong>
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        If both are Xbox users and are both connected on Xbox, they will be able to join each other through the
        <strong>
         Friends
        </strong>
        screen by selecting them and joining their experience
       </p>
      </li>
     </ul>

      Can I Play With My Friends Online From Their PC, Mac or Phone/Tablet?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Yes! You can play with your friends in the same server even if they're on a different platform. While Xbox players cannot see the in-experience chat, you can communicate with other players using Xbox Voice Chat.

      Are Other Roblox Website Features Like Friends, Chat, Groups, etc. Available on Xbox?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      You can always receive friend requests when playing Roblox on any platform. You can view your online Xbox friends from the
      <strong>
       Friends
      </strong>
      tab in Xbox and create a party to play with them. To view all of your friends, or accept/reject friend requests, you can do so by logging into your Roblox account on another platform such as PC or Mobile.
