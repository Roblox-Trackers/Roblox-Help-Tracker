      How Can I Play my Experiences With Friends?
     </h1>
     <div class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If you want to simply play your original experiences with friends, you can use
      <strong>
       My Experiences
      </strong>
      , which is found to the far right of the
      <strong>
       Experiences
      </strong>
      tab. Setting up My Experiences is fast and simple. Any experience published on the Roblox website will automatically appear on your Xbox account. Any updates published online will automatically sync with your My Experiences place on Xbox.
     </div>
     <div class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      From there, playing your experience on Xbox with friends is just as easy to do. The owner of the place can create an Xbox party with their Xbox friends. After that, they can jump directly into the experience with everyone in the party. Being social is at the core of what Roblox is all about and we hope everyone enjoys playing their own experiences on Xbox and sharing the experience with friends!
