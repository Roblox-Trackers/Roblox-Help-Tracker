      Animating your avatar with your movement is an entirely new way to express yourself and communicate with others on Roblox. The feature uses your device camera to mirror your movements and facial expressions onto your avatar in real time.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Users aged 13+ can opt-in to use this feature by visiting their Settings page.

      Roblox temporarily uses your device camera solely to animate your avatar. Roblox does not record or store any of the information that is captured from your device camera to animate your avatar. For more information, please review

      How do I know which experiences support animate your avatar with your movement?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      To find out if an experience has camera enabled, please review the experience details page that contains the “About” section. If you have enabled your device camera to animate your avatar with your movement, within the “About” section, the “Communication” field will indicate if the “Camera” is enabled.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       If only the “Microphone” is shown, that experience will only support chat with voice.
      </li>
      <li>
       If only the “Camera” is shown, that experience will only support animate your avatar with your movement.
      </li>
      <li>
       If both the “Microphone and Camera” are shown, that experience will support both chat with voice and animating your avatar with your movement.

     <h2>
      Are there in-experience controls to animate my avatar with my movement?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      When you join a camera enabled experience, you may receive a device / OS prompt to grant Roblox access to your device camera. Select “Allow” or else you will be unable to access the camera with your device. (If you previously blocked access to your device camera, go to your device’s application settings for Roblox to allow camera use).
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      After you join, you will have a new camera icon appear above your avatar’s head.
     </p>

     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1 wysiwyg-text-align-left">
      If you join a microphone and camera enabled experience and you have also enabled microphone and camera inputs, you will have both microphone and camera icons appear above your avatar’s head.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1 wysiwyg-text-align-left">

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1 wysiwyg-text-align-left">
      Your camera and/or microphone will default to off and you can turn them on and back off independently. If you turn on just the microphone input, your avatar’s mouth will lip sync based on your voice input. Lip syncing creates facial animation in real time by inferring the shapes your mouth makes for specific sounds during speech. When you enable your camera, your full facial expressions and head movements are matched by your avatar using information from your camera.

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Roblox will automatically use the system default the first time you join an experience with camera enabled. If you have multiple cameras attached to your device and would like to use an alternate one, you can do so in the experience settings menu. Press the Roblox tilt logo icon in the top left corner, select the “Settings” tab, scroll down to “Video Camera,” and select which camera you want to use.

      Self View
     </h3>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      When you enable your camera, it also automatically brings up a new Self View window showing your avatar. Self View helps make it easy and fun for you to see how your avatar’s facial animation reacts to your input in real time. Self View automatically moves the mic and camera icons from above your avatar’s head to a shelf underneath the Self View window. Self View is not required for you to use your camera and it can be repositioned or closed at any time (closing Self View brings back the mic and camera buttons above your avatar’s head).

      Microphone and camera controls are now also accessible by tapping the Roblox menu icon in the upper left side of the screen. Across the top bar of the menu are controls to mute all, turn on and off camera and microphone inputs, and show/hide Self View.

      How do I know if I have the right avatar head to animate my avatar?

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      To animate your avatar using your movement, your equipped avatar head needs to support facial animation. It is important to note that not all avatar heads will support facial animation immediately.

      for detailed information, by device, on how to customize your avatar. Once you have navigated to the Avatar page, for either “Customize” or “Marketplace,” select “Heads and Body.” Under the “Style” section you will see heads that support facial animation.
     </p>

      For both “Customize” and “Marketplace,” look for the icon on the thumbnail, a winking face, that lets you know the head supports facial animation.
