      TheÂ Leaderboard
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The leaderboard is a box located in the upper right corner of the experience window. It is here that you will be given information about the people you are playing with. This can include the teams they are on, their current score in the experience and status icons. You can even send a friend request, block someone, or report abuse simply by clicking on a player's name. Leaderboards will look something like this:

      So you may have a grasp on what exactly the leaderboards are, but may be wondering what those little icons next to people's names mean. Let's go through each one of them:

     <h2>
      In-Experience friend requests
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      While playing an experience, you may find that there's another player you would like to become friends with. If that's the case, there is no need to leave the experience to start this process. To send a friend request to someone, simply click on their name in the leaderboard and select Send Friend Request.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If one of your fellow players sends you a friend request, a notification will pop up in the lower right-hand corner of your screen. You may accept or decline by clicking the corresponding button. Alternatively, you may click on their name in the leaderboard and accept or decline from there.

      There are three types of notifications that you may see pop up to represent things that have happened in-experience. These will appear in grey boxes in the lower right corner (

      ) and will alert you to having earned a badge or that you have received a friend request from one of your fellow players. These are represented by the following images:
