     <h1>
      The Leaderboard
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The leaderboard is a box located in the upper right corner of the experience window. It is here that you will be given information about the people you are playing with. This can include the teams they are on, their current score in the experience and status icons. You can even send a friend request, follow a player, block someone, or report abuse simply by clicking on a player's name. Leaderboards will look something like this:

     <h2>
      In-Experience friend requests and following
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      While playing an experience, you may find that there's another player you would like to follow or become friends with. If that's the case, there is no need to leave the experience to start this process. To send a friend request to someone, simply click on their name in the leaderboard and select Send Friend Request. You may also choose to follow or unfollow them from this menu if you would rather.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If one of your fellow players sends you a friend request, a notification will pop up in the lower right-hand corner of your screen. You may accept or decline by clicking the corresponding button. Alternatively, you may click on their name in the leaderboard and accept or decline from there.
     </p>
