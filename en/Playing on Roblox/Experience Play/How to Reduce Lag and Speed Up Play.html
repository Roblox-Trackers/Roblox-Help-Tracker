      What is lag?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      It's where an experience appears to stutter or slow down, causing players to appear to be warping around the experience. It is generally a sign of a slow experience or connection.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Below are some things to check for when trying to address the issue of lagging:
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
     </p>
     <h3>
      Network Lag
     </h3>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      This type of lag occurs when your internet connection to Roblox is slow or unstable. This results in other players unpredictably warping around the world, or in-experience actions taking an unusual amount of time to complete. For this situation,
      <a href="/hc/articles/203312880/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       read the information on general connection problems
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
     </p>
     <h3>
      Graphics Lag
     </h3>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If your device isn't very powerful when it comes to playing Roblox, this often results in stuttering / choppy visuals. For this situation, check your Roblox graphics level.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       While playing, open the in-experience menu by pressing the
       <strong>
        Esc
       </strong>
       key.
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Go to
       <strong>
        Settings
       </strong>
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Under the
       <strong>
        GRAPHICS
       </strong>
       section, you can check the graphics level of Roblox.
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       To lower the level, first toggle the
       <strong>
        Graphics Quality - Auto
       </strong>
       to disable it. Then make any necessary adjustments to lower your level.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Lower graphics levels will reduce some of the image/visual quality but it also means that your device works less to run Roblox and may result in a better experience.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
     </p>
     <h3>
      System Lag
     </h3>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If lowering the graphics quality didn't improve the issue, check to make sure your device isn't running other high-power apps. If it is, try closing any unwanted apps to make sure they aren't taking up system resources that Roblox may need to run properly.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If your device still experiences lag beyond this, you may need to upgrade it or play Roblox on a more powerful device.
