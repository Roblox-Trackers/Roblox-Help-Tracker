      Roblox enables anyone to imagine and create immersive 3D experiences. You can spend Robux to buy perks, virtual items, and passes for these experiences from the creators that make them. Passes are sold on the Store tab of the experience’s page, and all other virtual items are sold directly inside the experience. Pricing, features, and quality are determined and maintained by the Creator and not by Roblox.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you are facing any issues with an in-experience item or pass, or if you have been banned by the Creator from a specific experience, you should reach out to the Creator directly for assistance. You can do this by sending a message or chatting on Roblox, posting on a group wall, or by reaching out via any Social Links that the Creator provides on their account, group, or experience page.
