      When an experience loads, it will automatically use gear you own of the allowed gear-types to fill the inventory bar at the bottom of the screen. Each of the ten inventory slots will list a hotkey in its upper-left corner indicating what number will need to be pressed on your keyboard to equip the item for use. Basic gear functions can be activated by clicking with your left mouse button, though some gear may have special functions that can generally be found in the description on the

      This will open up your backpack and allow you to rearrange your inventory. You can do this by clicking on an item and dragging it to a new position. To exit this mode, click the backpack icon again.
