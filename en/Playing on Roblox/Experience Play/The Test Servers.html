      Occasionally the engineers may need to test some new features or other upgrades for Roblox before pushing them out to everyone. At these times, we may enable users to log in and help out! However, it is important to note that these test servers will be opened and closed at various times potentially without warning.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the engineers are looking to publicly test something, there will typically be an announcement banner on our main site calling for helpful Robloxians to test out new features and changes along with a link to the particular server the test is taking place on.

      Additionally, please keep in mind that memberships on the test sites are for testing purposes only and are not actual purchases. Anything purchased on a test site will remain connected to that server only and cannot be transferred to the main site.

      Please note that Customer Support cannot assist with accounts on the test sites.
