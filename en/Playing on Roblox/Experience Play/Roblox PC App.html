       Roblox App Differences
      </span>
     </h1>
     <p>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       While you may be familiar with most of the interface if you’ve been playing Roblox normally, there are some key differences to note while playing on the App version.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       <br/>
       Main Menu
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       You’ll see that several features are directly available in the Roblox App’s main menu, such as the Home Page, Experiences Page, Avatar Editor, and Chat Window. You may open any of these on the left panel when first opening the App.
      </span>
      <span>
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Leave Experience (L)
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       This button makes the player exit the experience, making the player disconnect from the server they were on. After clicking the button, there is another message to confirm if they want to leave.
      </span>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       Leaving experiences in this manner will not close the experience window, and will instead return you to the main menu.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       To fully exit immediately, you may
       <span>
