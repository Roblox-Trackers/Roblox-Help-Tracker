      A PlayStation console is required to play Roblox experiences, as well as an internet connection. You can find Roblox in the PlayStation Store.

      There are many different experiences you can play on Roblox. When you first start out, you can find them on the Home screen and Experiences screen. After you've played some experiences, you'll also find your recently played experiences on the Home screen.
