      To play with your Roblox friends on PlayStation, you can do the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       When both users simultaneously press
       <strong>
        Play
       </strong>
       on the same experience page, they will have more of a chance to play in the same server.
      </li>
      <li>
       In order to make sure that both players get into the same experience, the PlayStation user must join first, then the user on the other platform may open your profile and click
       <strong>
        Join Experience.
       </strong>
      </li>
      <li>
       If both are PlayStation users and are both connected on PlayStation, they will be able to join each other through the Friends screen by selecting them and joining their experience.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>

      Can I play with my friends online from their PC, Mac or Phone/Tablet?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Yes! You can play with your friends on the same server even if they're on a different platform.

      Are other Roblox website features like Friends, Chat, Groups, etc. available on PlayStation?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      You can always receive friend requests when playing Roblox on any platform. You can view your online PlayStation friends from the
      <strong>
       Friends
      </strong>
      section in PlayStation and create a party to play with them. To view all of your friends, or accept/reject friend requests, you can do so by logging into your Roblox account on another platform such as PC or Mobile.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      For now, PlayStation players cannot see the in-experience chat or communicate with other players using Chat with Voice.
