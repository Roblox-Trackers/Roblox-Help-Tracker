      Using the Group Audit Log
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      On the Group Audit page, you will be shown all activity in the group by default listed from the most recent change to the oldest change. If you would like to just see certain types of changes (post deletions, kicking users...etc.), you can select this from the
      <strong>
       Filter by Action
      </strong>
      box. You can also search for actions performed by any specific user, using the search box available along with the Action box.
