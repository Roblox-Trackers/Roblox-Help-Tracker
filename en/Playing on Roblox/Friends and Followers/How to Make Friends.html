      Roblox is a fantastic place to build worlds, play experiences and to expand your creativity, but it's also a great place to create and maintain friendships with your fellow Robloxians! If you already know who you would like to be your friend, you can find them by searching for their username in the Search field at the top of the screen. You can also meet new people in experiences and groups, and get to know them.

     <ol>
      <li>
       Get to their Profile. The easiest way to get to this is by typing the person's username into the search bar at the top of the screen and selecting to search in the
       <strong>
        People
       </strong>
       category. Once you find the person's profile you are looking for, click on that person's username.
      </li>
      <li>
       Select the
       <strong>
        Add Friend
       </strong>
       option on their profile. If it doesn't come up it means that person is already your friend.
      </li>
     </ol>

       Note: While not required, it is recommended that you send a polite message to the other player notifying them of your request as that person may not know or remember who you are

     <h1>
      What happens after I send my request?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      You wait until the person receives your request. If they accept, you will get a message titled "Friend Request: Accepted". If they decline, you will get a message titled "Friend Request: Declined". Don't be too down if someone declines; it may just mean that they didn't remember you as well as you thought they might or they clicked the wrong button. You can try sending another Friend Request, but remember: multiple Friend Requests can get annoying.
     </p>

     <h1>
      How do I check my friend requests?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The current number of your pending friend requests will display to the right of "Friends" in the left navigation bar underneath your username.  You can click on Friends to view them.  From here you can accept or decline Friend Requests. If, however, that number is not present, then you do not currently have any waiting on your approval.

      How do I delete friends?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If you no longer wish to have someone in your friends list, you may wish to delete them. To do this, first, navigate to their profile. Once there, you will see a box at the top of the page containing their username, some buttons, and friends/follower information. Click the Unfriend button and they will be removed from your list.

      Adding somebody as a friend will add them to your Friends section, allowing you to quickly go to their profile by clicking on them. You can also make personal servers friends only and can make it to where only friends can communicate with you in certain situations by visiting the

      How do I set an alias for a friend?
     </h1>
     <p>
      Aliases are a feature that allows you to set a personalized nickname for users that are your friends. Only you will be able to see an alias that you create.
     </p>
     <p>
      There will be an alias section on the profile page of your friends. You can change or add an alias by clicking the edit button:
     </p>
     <p>
      <img alt="Alias1.png" src="/hc/article_attachments/360040502931/Alias1.png"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      Type the alias you would like to use, and press
      <strong>
       Save
      </strong>
      :
     </p>
     <p>
      <img alt="Alias2.PNG" height="186" src="/hc/article_attachments/360040498612/Alias2.PNG" width="353"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      In chat, aliases will appear in a few places. The alias will be in parentheses to the right of the Roblox username, as in the example below:
     </p>
     <p>
      <img alt="Alias3.png" src="/hc/article_attachments/360040503831/Alias3.png"/>
     </p>
     <p>
