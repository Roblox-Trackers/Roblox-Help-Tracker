      Experience Notifications are a new way for 13+ users to keep up with the most important moments in their favorite experiences. Developers can send opted-in users personalized notifications to notify them about activity that is specifically relevant to them.

      Opt-In
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Users can turn on notifications from an experience on the Experience Details Page via the "Notify" bell icon. For 13+ users, this will opt them into both Experience Updates (legacy feature also known as “Game Updates”) and Experience Notifications. For under 13 users, this will opt them into only Experience Updates as Experience Notifications are 13+ only. Users who already opted into notifications via the legacy opt-in flow (“Notify” was previously called “Follow”) will not have their opt-in status cleared.

      Users can comprehensively manage all the experiences they have turned on notifications for in their Notifications Settings in Preferences. They can toggle each experience listed to “off” to opt-out. They will get a confirmation pop-up and if they confirm their intent to opt-out, the experience will be removed from their preferences page.

      Receiving a Notification
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Notifications are delivered to the Roblox Notification Stream. This can be accessed via the bell icon on the top right corner of Roblox’s homepage. Notifications are delivered silently to the Stream, almost like an email to an inbox (no interruptive element). Users can take 4 actions on the notification:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       “Join” brings the user into the experience
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       “Dismiss” deletes the notification
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       “Turn off Notifications” opts the user out of notifications from the experience
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       “Report” opens the abuse report flow
      </li>
     </ul>
