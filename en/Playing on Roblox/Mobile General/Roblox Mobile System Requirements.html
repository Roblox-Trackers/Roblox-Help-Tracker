      Android warning screens

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Due to the very large number of Android devices in existence, we cannot be certain that all devices will run optimally even if they are running the correct version of the operating system and do not have a Tegra 2 chipset.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      We have 2 levels of unsupported Android devices - skippable and unskippable:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Skippable Devices
       </strong>
       : These types of devices will get a warning telling you that your device may not be powerful enough to play experiences smoothly. This is just a warning to let you know that while your device isn't specifically supported, experiences might still run though they will likely lag a little (or a lot). Tapping outside the warning box will make it go away and the experience should keep loading.
       <br/>
       <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Unskippable Devices
       </strong>
       : will get a message that informs you that your device doesn't meet the minimum system requirements. This means the device is not able to play experiences on Roblox. This message usually shows up on devices that use the Tegra 2 graphics chipset or a processor older than ARMv7. These kinds of tablets/phones do not support features that the Roblox needs to be able to function. However, users with these unskippable messages will still be able to access all other parts of the app outside of experiences.
