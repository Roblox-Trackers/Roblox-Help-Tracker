       Q:
      </strong>
      <strong>
       After uploading my ID, my verification has been pending for a long time. What is happening?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       A: Make sure the image you capture is clear and the entire document is in the frame. Blurry images will take a longer time to process. Documents in certain countries may also take longer than others, such as when non-Roman characters are present.

      <br/>
      A:
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       We use advanced image processing technology to ensure your documents are legitimate, and that you are in fact who you say you are. Once verification is complete, we anonymize your identity and discard any personal data we collect from your documents except your date of birth. We use date of birth to ensure that the age on your account is accurate. To learn how Roblox processes your personal and biometric data, refer to the

      <strong>
       Roblox never stores raw ID document data
      </strong>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       . When a government-issued ID is scanned for verification, an anonymized value is generated, allowing Roblox to safely verify identity without risking exposure of the user’s real identity.

       <strong>
        Q: I noticed something called Persona in the verification process. What is Persona, and why is Roblox using them?
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A: Roblox has partnered with Persona, a third-party service provider, to verify the identity of account owners who wish to access additional social features and age-appropriate content. Information uploaded to Persona is retained for a period of 90 days. After this period, the uploaded data is removed from Persona. Roblox does not receive any raw identification information. Please note that a government-issued photo ID: Passport, Driver's License, State ID card, or Residence Permit, is required to upload for verification. For more information on Persona's data privacy practices and their privacy policy, please follow this link:

       Q: Can I verify my ID on more than one account?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: Age ID Verification cannot be completed on multiple user accounts by a single ID. Users may only verify their ID on ONE Roblox account.
