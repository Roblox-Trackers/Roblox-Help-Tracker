       Q: Why is the wait to upload my ID so long?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       A: Please hang tight! Due to significant interest in sign ups for our spatial voice beta, some users are experiencing long wait times when trying to verify their age. We realize that this is not an ideal user experience. We are working towards solutions and encourage you to keep an eye on the
       <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/" target="_self">

       </a>
       for updates. But in the meantime, please continue to wait if you are already in line to verify your age as restarting a new request may lead to further delays.

       Q: After uploading my ID, my verification has been pending for a long time. What is happening?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       A: Make sure the image you capture is clear and the entire document is in the frame. Blurry images will take a longer time to process. Documents in certain countries may also take longer than others, such as when non-Roman characters are present.

      <strong>
       Q: How do I know when my age is verified?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A:
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       After you finish submitting your document and selfie for verification, In Settings &gt; Account Information, you should see an indicator under your birthday that says “Age Verified” with a checkmark next to it.

     <p>
      <strong>
       Q: How are my documents and face used?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A:
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       We use advanced image processing technology to ensure your documents are legitimate, and that you are in fact who you say you are. Once verification is complete, we discard all raw document data and anonymize your identity.

      <strong>
       Q: I don’t see an option to verify my age yet and I’m above 13.
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A:
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       Age verification is rolling out gradually over the next several weeks. It may take some time before this feature is available to you.

      <strong>
       Q: What if the birthday on my ID is different from the one on my Roblox account?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A:
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       Don’t worry. If you successfully verify your age, we will correct the birthday on your Roblox account with the one you provided on your ID document.

      <strong>
       Q: Is it safe to verify my age this way?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A:
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       Yes! We want you to know that we take our community’s safety and privacy seriously, and

       Roblox never stores raw ID document data
      </strong>
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       . When a government-issued ID is scanned for verification, an anonymized value is generated, allowing Roblox to safely verify identity without risking exposure of the user’s real identity.

      <strong>
       Q: My verified age is incorrect. How do I fix this?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A:
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       Even after verifying your age, you can change your birthday anytime. Note that changing your birthday will un-verify your age and revoke access to any content and features that require age verification. If you are above 13, you can verify your age again if you wish.

       Q: What countries and document types are supported for age verification?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A:
      <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       Age verification is already supported in over 180 countries globally. In most countries, you will be able to use a driver’s license, residency card, or passport.

       Q: I noticed something called Veriff in the verification process. What is Veriff, and why is Roblox using them?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A: Roblox has partnered with Veriff, a third-party service provider, to verify the identity of account owners who wish to access additional social features and age-appropriate content. Information uploaded to Veriff is retained for a period of 90 days. After this period, the uploaded data is removed from Veriff. Roblox does not receive any raw identification information. Please note that a government-issued ID is required to upload for verification. For more information on Veriff's data privacy practices, please click

      <strong>
       Q: Can I verify my ID on more than one account?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: Age ID Verification cannot be completed on multiple user accounts by a single ID. Users may only verify their ID on ONE Roblox account.
