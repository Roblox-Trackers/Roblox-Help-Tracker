      <strong>
       Why are you collecting this consent?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Today, phone numbers are only used for two-step verification to provide additional security for your account. Roblox is creating a new feature that will allow you to connect with your friends on Roblox by using your phone number to help make those recommendations. We want to ensure your privacy and get your permission for this new use of your phone number.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       How will my phone number be used?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      If you allow friends to find you, phone verified users with your phone number may see you as a friend recommendation. Friend recommendations may appear with names from a user’s contacts and are not verified (i.e., someone’s mom may show as "Mom," not "Mary Smith"). Roblox will only use your phone number for the purposes in which you consented.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       How do I opt-in to being discoverable?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      You can opt in to being discoverable only after you verify your phone number. You will have the option to provide consent immediately after you verify your phone number, or can opt-in under Settings -&gt; Privacy at any time.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       How can I turn off this feature later?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      You can opt out of being discoverable to others by your phone number at any time by going to Settings -&gt; Privacy within your account.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       What about my privacy? Who can see my phone number?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Roblox users will not be able to see your phone number. Roblox does not share your phone number or contacts with any third parties.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you opt in, anyone that has your phone number can send you a friend request, even if you do not know them. Make sure you are not friending users you do not recognize! If you prefer to remain completely anonymous and have no risk of this happening, select “no” when asked “Do you want to be recommended to Roblox users who have your phone number?” You can always change this setting under Settings -&gt; Privacy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       What will others who already have my phone number be able to see?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      If you consent, a phone verified user with your phone number will see the name attached to your phone number on their device contacts in a friend recommendation. This may be your real first and last name.

      Importing Contacts FAQ
     </h2>
     <p>
      <strong>
       How do I find people I know on Roblox?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      There are multiple ways to find people on Roblox: for example, you can search for their username or you can connect your device’s contact list in the app. If you connect contacts, we will suggest discoverable users on Roblox that are in your contacts. To connect contacts, go to Add Friends → Connect with Friends.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       What happens when I connect Roblox to my device’s contact list?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      If you connect contacts, we will suggest users on Roblox that are in your contacts. You can access this list any time after you opt in to contact import by selecting “connect with friends” on the Add Friends page. Contact names will be shown as they appear on your phone on friend’s profiles so you can identify your friends.
     </p>
     <p>
      When your contact list is connected, it’s periodically synced and securely stored on our servers. You can delete synced contacts at any time.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       When I send a friend request from imported contacts, will the other user know who I am?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Yes, the friend request you send will come from your Roblox profile. Additionally, if you’ve set your phone number to be discoverable and you are in their device’s contacts, your name as it appears in their contacts may be shown along with the friend request to help them understand who the friend request is coming from.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       What data will Roblox store when I import contacts? How can I delete this data?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      When you upload your contacts, we may store contact names as stored in your device. We do not store phone numbers or email addresses of people in your contact book. At any point, you can delete contact data under Settings → Privacy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       How do I disconnect contact syncing?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      To stop syncing your contact list, you can toggle this feature off at any time under Settings → Privacy. When opted out, you will no longer see friend recommendations based on your contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you’ve synced contact data on multiple devices, you must do this separately per device or go to your privacy settings on a desktop web browser to delete all synced data at once. Friends added from contacts will not be deleted.
