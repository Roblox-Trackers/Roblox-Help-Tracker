      Email notifications help you stay updated on login events

     <p>
      If you have a verified email address on your account, every time there is a new login event (a login that occurs from a new device or IP address), Roblox will send you an email notification with approximate device details, regional location, and timing of the login event. These notifications allow you to stay updated on login events such that you can take action as soon as a suspicious login occurs.
