       If you have a verified email address on your account, Roblox will send you an email for the following activity:
      </span>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Every time there is a new login event (a login that occurs from a new device or IP address)
      </li>
     </ul>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Every time a trade or transaction attempt is made that requires 2-Step Verification
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <span>
       The notification email will contain approximate info on the event time, regional location, and device. These notifications allow you to stay updated on events such that you can take action as soon as suspicious activity occurs.
