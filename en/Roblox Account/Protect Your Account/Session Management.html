     <p>
      The
      <strong>
       Where you’re logged in
      </strong>
      section within your account security settings will show all logged-in sessions (along with approximate regional location,
      <strong>
       last active
      </strong>
      timing, and device for each session). From this view, you can choose to log out of individual sessions of your choice, or log out of all sessions other than the one you’re currently in.

      Why is it useful?
     </h2>
     <ul>
      <li>
       In one consolidated screen, you can view all of your logged-in sessions, helping you see potentially suspicious sessions.
      </li>
      <li>
       If you think that any of your logged-in sessions may be suspicious, you can log out of each of these sessions individually to secure your account.
      </li>
     </ul>
