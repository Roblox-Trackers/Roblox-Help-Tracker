         Never Share Your Password or Cookies
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        The most common way players lose their account is by sharing their login information directly with others or by filling out online surveys. If anyone asks for your login, do not give it to them and be sure to report them to our moderators using the

        It's not just passwords though. Never give out your browser cookies, personal details, or sensitive computer information either. If someone tells you they know this awesome trick or hack and just need some particular information from you to get it to work, they are just trying to steal your account.

        One common trick are claims of getting a sweet prize or free Robux in exchange for account details. Any officially supported Roblox promotions will be announced through the

         Enable 2-Step Verification (2SV)

       </p>
       <p>
        This feature makes it so no one else can login to the account even if they know the password. When you log in from a new device Roblox will send you a code via email, and you can not log in without that code. Since only you have access to your email account, only you will be able to get the security code.

         Always Log Out of Your Account When You're Done Playing
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        If you leave your account logged in on a computer, anyone else can use that computer and have access to your account. It’s important you always log out after playing, especially when using a shared computer such as at school or friend's house.

         Make Your Password Unique
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        You should have a different password for every online account you have. Don't re-use a password you used on another account. Also, make your passwords hard to guess. Common passwords such as pass123 or using part of your username as a password are easy to guess.

        Never Add Someone Else’s Email Address on Your Account
       </strong>
       <p>
        The only email address you should have verified under your account page is your own or a parent's. If you put someone else’s email address there, then they will receive the password reset emails and can then gain access to your account and lock you out of it.

        Learn to Recognize Scam and Phishing Sites
       </strong>
       <p>
        As a general rule of thumb, you should NEVER click on any links to sites you do not know. The only links allowed on Roblox are links to other pages from roblox.com or those specified in the

        Don't Get Tricked by In-game Forms
       </strong>
       <p>
        Only enter your login information when logging in through the official roblox.com website or on the login screen of the official Roblox apps. If a game asks for this information for any reason at all, even if it looks like an official Roblox request, leave the game and use the Report Abuse link located on the game's details page.

        Get Parent Permission Before Downloading Programs
       </strong>
       <p>
        There are bad programs out there called malware and keyloggers. Never download or run a program (.exe file) without your parent's permission. Any program you download should be from a trusted company source. Malware programs can collect your personal information such as passwords. We also recommend checking and removing browser extensions.

         Beware of browser extensions
        </strong>
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">
         : Roblox does NOT create browser extensions. There are no official Roblox browser extensions available for use. If you choose to use browser extensions published by 3rd party developers, we recommend you follow the guidelines below:
