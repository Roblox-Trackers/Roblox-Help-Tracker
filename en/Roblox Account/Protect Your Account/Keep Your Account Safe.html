         Always Log Out of Your Account When You're Done Playing
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        If you leave your account logged in on a computer, anyone else can use that computer and have access to your account. It’s important you always log out after playing, especially when using a shared computer such as at school or friend's house.

        <strong>
         Make Your Password Unique
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        You should have a different password for every online account you have. Don't re-use a password you used on another account. Also, make your passwords hard to guess. Common passwords such as pass123 or using part of your username as a password are easy to guess.

       <strong>
        Never Add Someone Else’s Email Address on Your Account
       </strong>
       <p>
        The only email address you should have verified under your account page is your own or a parent's. If you put someone else’s email address there, then they will receive the password reset emails and can then gain access to your account and lock you out of it.

        Learn to Recognize Scam and Phishing Sites
       </strong>
       <p>
        As a general rule of thumb, you should NEVER click on any links to sites you do not know. The only links allowed on Roblox are links to other pages from roblox.com or those specified in the

        Don't Get Tricked by In-experience Forms
       </strong>
       <p>
        Only enter your login information when logging in through the official roblox.com website or on the login screen of the official Roblox apps. If an experience asks for this information for any reason at all, even if it looks like an official Roblox request, leave the experience and use the Report Abuse link located on the experience's details page.

        Get Parent Permission Before Downloading Programs
       </strong>
       <p>
        There are bad programs out there called malware and keyloggers. Never download or run a program (.exe file) without your parent's permission. Any program you download should be from a trusted company source. Malware programs can collect your personal information such as passwords. We also recommend checking and removing browser extensions.

        <span style="font-weight: 400;">
