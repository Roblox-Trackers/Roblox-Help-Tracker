      Recovering your account
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Let's look at some steps to take for getting your account back on track.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Remove Off-site Downloads or Browser Extensions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       <p>
        You will need to get rid of any malware before recovering your account. If you've accidentally downloaded something from a bad site, this could allow your account to be compromised again.
       </p>
       <p>
        Run a
        <em>
         full
        </em>
        virus scan on your computer to remove harmful files and programs. Restart your computer and run the scan one more time to be safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any browser extensions installed should be removed. Only use extensions from safe and verified websites.

       We need to make sure we're talking to the original account owner. Contact us from the first email address added to the account, or from the billing email address that was used for the very first payment made on the account. Even if your account is compromised and the email is changed, we can still see the original owner or billing email on the account
      </li>
      <li>
       If your account did not have an email address or a credit card/PayPal purchase, we can still work with you to try to verify ownership and return the account.

       We recommend that you enable 2-step verification via an authenticator app to make your account more secure. This would help keep your account safe even if your password or email is stolen. In the event that your account is ever compromised, you must notify Roblox within 30 days. Customer Support will evaluate the safety measures you put in place as we try to help you recover any lost value.  Unfortunately, if we are not notified within this time, we are not typically able to recover the account’s inventory.

      Roblox does not support and can not enforce or recover inventory for players making deals for items or currency outside of our official systems. You should never make a trade or purchase outside the system because the other person could trick you and back out. You can read more about

      Report players attempting to make these deals with the Report Abuse feature. Stealing accounts or items or currency is a severe violation of the Terms of Use. Any and all associated accounts involved in theft will be deleted.

      Stay safe and secure! If something sounds too good to be true, don't risk it. You are the best defense against your account being compromised.
