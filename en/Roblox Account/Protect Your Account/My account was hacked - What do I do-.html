       <br/>
       <p>
        You will need to get rid of any malware before recovering your account. If you've accidentally downloaded something from a bad site, this could allow your account to be compromised again.

        Run a
        <em>
         full
        </em>
        virus scan on your computer to remove harmful files and programs. Restart your computer and run the scan one more time to be safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any browser extensions installed should be removed. Only use extensions from safe and verified websites.
