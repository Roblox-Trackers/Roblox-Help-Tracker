      The Account Session Protection feature, which is turned on by default for everyone, helps secure users by making your session specific to your device. This will prevent bad actors from stealing users’ accounts via session hijacking. This feature is only available to select accounts at this time.

      Turning off Account Session Protection
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The Account Session Protection feature is designed to keep your account safe, but some creators may want to call Roblox APIs in their own scripts or browser extensions. Account Session Protection may break these tools, so creators have the option to turn this feature off. We suggest that you only turn off Account Session Protection on test accounts that don’t have Robux or other value associated with them.
