      Why is it Important?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      This feature has several benefits to protect your account.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       This feature makes sure no one else can login to your account, even if they know the password.
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Since only you have access to the authenticator app or your email account, only you will be able to get the security code.

       Extra security so that you don't lose access to your experiences, Robux limiteds and more.
