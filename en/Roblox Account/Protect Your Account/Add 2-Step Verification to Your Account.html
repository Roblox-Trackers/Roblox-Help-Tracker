      What is 2-Step Verification?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      This feature makes sure no one else can login to your account, even if they know the password. When you log in from a new device you'll enter a unique security code from an authenticator app or Roblox sends you via email. Since only you have access to these sources, only you will be able to get the security code.

      Account Restores Eligibility
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      To be eligible for account restores, we require that you have an authenticator app set up to protect your account. Also, you must notify Roblox within 30 days of the account being compromised. Unfortunately, if we are not notified within this time, we are not typically able to recover the accountâ€™s inventory.
