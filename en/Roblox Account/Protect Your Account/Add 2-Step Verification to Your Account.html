      Account Restores Eligibility
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      To be eligible for account restores, we require that you have an authenticator app set up to protect your account. Also, you must notify Roblox within 30 days of the account being compromised. Unfortunately, if we are not notified within this time, we are not typically able to recover the accountâ€™s inventory.
