      What is a passkey?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Passkeys are secure and easy-to-use alternatives to passwords. With a passkey, you can log in using the method you already use to unlock your device, without having to remember your passwords. Behind the scenes, passkeys use public-key cryptography to generate cryptographic key pairs that are unique to your account and specific to Roblox.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      <br/>
      Once created, passkeys synchronize across your devices under the same Apple, Google, or Windows platform accounts or the password manager you use, ensuring your digital keys are always at hand. For more information about passkeys, refer to resources provided by

      While passkeys offer a robust layer of security, we do not recommend adding passkeys on shared devices. If you have a passkey set up on a shared device, those who can unlock the devices may gain access to your account.

      In such cases, promptly remove the passkey from Settings.

      If you have 2-Step Verification enabled on your account, and choose to log in with a passkey, you will not be asked to pass a 2-Step Verification challenge.

      What devices are compatible with passkeys?
     </h3>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      You can now use passkeys to login to your Roblox accounts on iOS devices and Web browsers. The following devices support passkeys:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent2">
       A mobile device that runs at least iOS 16.
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent2">
       A computer that runs at least Windows 10, macOS Ventura, or ChromeOS 109

         Supported browsers: Chrome version 109 or later, Safari version 16 or later, Edge version 109 or later.

      What should I do if I can’t find passkeys on the login screen?
     </h3>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      If you previously saved a passkey to your account but aren't prompted to use it at login, the troubleshooting steps depend on your device:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent2">
       If your current device uses the same operating system as the one with the saved passkey (e.g., from one iOS device to another), ensure you're logged into the same iCloud or Google account used when the passkey was saved. Also, consider updating your device to the latest system version.
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent2">
       If your current device operates under a different system than the one with the saved passkey (e.g., from an iOS device to a Windows computer), passkeys will not synchronize. However, you can still regain access to your account by other methods, such as Quick Login, Email One-Time Code, or password. After successfully logging in, we recommend adding a passkey on the new device for easier future access.
      </li>
     </ul>
