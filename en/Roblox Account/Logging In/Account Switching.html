      Will accounts added to the Account Switcher show up on other devices or visible to other people?
     </h2>
     <p>
      No. Accounts on the account switcher are completely private and only stored on your device. It does not show other users which accounts you are switching between and won’t show up on your other devices.

      I have multiple accounts. If I violate Roblox’s Terms of Use, and the Trust and Safety team decides to take action on my account, will they take action on more than one of my accounts?
     </h2>
     <p>
      To keep our community safe, if a user violates our Community Standards, we may take action on different accounts that we determine belong to the same user. There are several factors we consider when making that determination.
