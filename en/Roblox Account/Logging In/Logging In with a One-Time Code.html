      Safety tips

     <ul>
      <li>
       Never share a one-time code with anyone. Roblox will never contact you to ask for it.
      </li>
      <li>
       If you receive an email containing a one-time code without requesting it, you can safely ignore it.
      </li>
      <li>
       If you receive multiple unwanted emails containing One-Time Codes, we strongly advise you to change the email on your account and
