      Other ways
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      These methods will only work if there was an email or phone number added to the account before you forgot the username. The only other way to locate the username is if you made a purchase on Roblox. Some purchase receipts include the username.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Sadly, without an email, phone number, or purchase history there is no way to recover the account.
