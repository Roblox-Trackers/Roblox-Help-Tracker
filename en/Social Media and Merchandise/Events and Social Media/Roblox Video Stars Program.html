      How do I join?
     </h1>
     <p>
      Applications for 2023 admissions for the Roblox Video Stars Program are currently closed. Due to the updates we are currently making to the application process and program itself we have delayed reviewing new applications until early 2024. This means we will not be adding anymore influencers into the program this year so if you have previously applied we apologize for the delay. You will be asked to reapply once the new system is in place and will update our help article once applications are open.

      Transparency rules
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      All Participants must be transparent about their relationship with us. If you are a member of our Video Stars Program, you must disclose to your viewers and followers any material connection to us within the content where you discuss Roblox, such as posts to social media, video content, and livestreams.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       A “material connection” is anything that might affect the weight or credibility of your statements about Roblox. Examples of material connections include participation in the Influencer Program, receiving payment from Roblox, free Roblox swag, free Robux, early access to an event, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
       Depending on the type of benefit you receive from us, you may say something like: “I’m a member of the Roblox Influencer Program, and I may receive some perks and benefits from Roblox,” or “Roblox granted me early access to this event,” or “Thanks for the Robux, Roblox!”
      </li>
      <li>
       Every time you offer your fans a code you have been assigned by Roblox, you must make it clear that you will be paid a commission if they use that code.
       <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>
         In your videos (including livestream), you must make a disclosure right before you offer the code. You may say: “If you use this code, I will receive a commission from Roblox”, or something similar. The disclosure should be made in the video itself (if the Code is offered in the video) and in the description of the video.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
       Disclosures should be clear and easily visible or audible, regardless of any social media platform space limitations (e.g., Twitter). Hashtags such as #Ad, #Sponsored, or #Paid may be acceptable on some platforms but must be easy to find. Don’t bury them below the “More” line or in a series of other hashtags.
      </li>
      <li>
       Videos must include disclosures in the video itself (such as on a graphic overlay), not just in the description.
       <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>
         If your content is a livestream, you must repeat the disclosure from time to time to ensure that your viewers have a chance to see or hear it.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
       All disclosures must be made in the same language as your content.
      </li>
      <li>
       If you are not sure whether a disclosure is needed, you should go ahead and disclose.
      </li>
      <li>
       Generally, you should also include information in your profile pages indicating that you accept and review products or services, as well as any conflicts of interest that may affect the credibility of your reviews.
      </li>
      <li>
       Please note that third-party platform rules and your local laws may impose additional requirements on influencers. Please make sure you follow all the rules and laws that apply to you.
      </li>
      <li>
       This is not a comprehensive list of all of the requirements that may apply to you, based on where you live and the makeup of your audience.
       <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>
         If you live in the United States, or your content is targeted towards a U.S. audience please be sure to carefully review and follow the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Guidelines as the list in this section does not include all of the FTC guidelines relating to endorsements and testimonials. For more information, please visit the FTC’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising and related FAQs.
        </li>
        <li>
         If you live outside of the U.S., or your content directly targets consumers in another jurisdiction, you may also have to comply with laws in other jurisdictions. For example:
         <ol class="lowerroman">
          <li>
           For legal residents of Canada, this includes, but is not limited to, the Competition Act, applicable Competition Bureau regulatory guidance, the Canadian Code of Advertising Standards, and Ad Standards Interpretation Guidelines.
          </li>
          <li>
           For the United Kingdom, the rules differ as follows: When you make disclosures, you should use disclosures such as "ad", "advertisement", "paid for ad", "ad feature"; You must not use the disclosures "sponsored" or "spon.” Also, videos should include disclosures which are visible before the viewer clicks on or watches the video. This could be in the title of the video or in a thumbnail which is visible before the viewer watches the video. It is not enough for the disclosure to be in the video itself.
          </li>
