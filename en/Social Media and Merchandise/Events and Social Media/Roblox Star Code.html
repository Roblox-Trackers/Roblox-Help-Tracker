      What is the Roblox Star Code?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The Roblox Star Code is a special code that you can get from a member of the Roblox Video Stars Program. When you use a Star Code to support a Video Star, they will automatically earn 5% of the Robux purchase you make on the Roblox website. You will still receive the full amount of Robux you paid for, with the added bonus of knowing that youâ€™ve contributed to your favorite Video Star!

       Note: Star Codes can be applied to purchases on the Roblox website and on the Roblox App.
