      Roblox enables anyone to imagine and create immersive 3D experiences. You can buy perks and virtual items directly from these experience developers for Robux.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Experience passes are sold on the experience's Store page, and all other virtual items are sold inside the experience.
      </li>
      <li>
       Pricing and quality are determined and maintained by the Developer and not by Roblox.
      </li>
      <li>
       Try contacting the experience's developer through private messages or their groups.
