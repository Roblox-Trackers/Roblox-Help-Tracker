      Game passes, like VIP shirts, give players special perks and abilities in games. These added abilities can be anything, from super strength or speed, to a special item—
      <em>
       the benefits are up to the game creator
      </em>
      .

      Game passes are free to create. Then you can sell them for the amount of Robux you choose. For help with creating a pass,

      Robux earned from Game Passes are placed in a
      <em>
       pending
      </em>
      status for up to seven days before being paid to the account. This pending status is called escrow. You can check your
      <strong>
       pending sales
      </strong>
      by viewing your

      . Additionally, as with all sales, these funds will be subject to a transaction fee.
