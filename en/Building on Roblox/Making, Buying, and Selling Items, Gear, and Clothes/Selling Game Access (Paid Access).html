      What is Selling Access?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Selling access is like an entrance fee for your place or game -- it means that a buyer will have to pay to play your game. The buyer will only be given access to your game, they will not be able to download or copy it.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h1>
      Why Should I Sell Access?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      To make more Robux! You should know, though, that buyers expect paid access games to be high quality. If you try to sell a buggy, bad, or misleading game don’t expect to earn much.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h1>
      How Much Can I Charge?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The price for paid access is configurable from a minimum of 25 Robux to a maximum of 1000 Robux.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h1>
      Are There Any Restrictions on Selling Access?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      New accounts must wait 30 days before they are able to sell access. Paid access games must be copylocked. Paid games must be available to anyone that has bought access. (
      <em>
       E.g. they cannot be 'Friends Only'.
      </em>
      ) Paid games must comply with all aspects of our Terms of Use.

      Who Can Sell Access?

     <h1>
      How is Selling Access Different from Selling a Game Pass?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Game passes are used to offer extra features (
      <em>
       such as VIP rooms, special powers, and the like
      </em>
      ) within a game; access is for entrance to the game or place itself.
     </p>

     <h1>
      Can I Also Sell Game Passes, Gear, and Items for My Game if I Sell Access to My Game?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Yes.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h1>
      When Will I Get My Robux for Selling Access?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Robux earned from selling access is placed in escrow for up to seven days before being paid out.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h1>
      What Happens if People Don't Like the Game?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If a number of complaints are received about a game with paid access – for example, if the game is not as advertised, is broken, or otherwise unplayable, the game will be quarantined and the developer given the opportunity to fix any issues. Any earnings from that game at the time of quarantine still in escrow will be refunded to buyers.
