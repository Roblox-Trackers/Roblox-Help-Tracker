      What is Selling Access?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Selling access is like an entrance fee for your place or experience -- it means that a buyer will have to pay to play your experience. The buyer will only be given access to your experience, they will not be able to download or copy it.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h1>
      Why Should I Sell Access?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      To make more Robux! You should know, though, that buyers expect paid access experiences to be high quality. If you try to sell a buggy, bad, or misleading experience don’t expect to earn much.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h1>
      How Much Can I Charge?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The price for paid access is configurable from a minimum of 25 Robux to a maximum of 1000 Robux.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h1>
      Are There Any Restrictions on Selling Access?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      New accounts must wait 30 days before they are able to sell access. Paid access experiences must be copylocked. Paid experiences must be available to anyone that has bought access. (
      <em>
       E.g. they cannot be 'Friends Only'.
      </em>
      ) Paid experiences must comply with all aspects of our Terms of Use.

     <h1>
      How is Selling Access Different from Selling an Experience Pass?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Experience passes are used to offer extra features (
      <em>
       such as VIP rooms, special powers, and the like
      </em>
      ) within an experience; access is for entrance to the experience or place itself.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h1>
      Can I Also Sell Experience Passes, Gear, and Items for My Experience if I Sell Access to My Experience?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Yes.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h1>
      When Will I Get My Robux for Selling Access?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Robux earned from selling access is placed in escrow for up to seven days before being paid out.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h1>
      What Happens if People Don't Like the Experience?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      If a number of complaints are received about an experience with paid access – for example, if the experience is not as advertised, is broken, or otherwise unplayable, the experience will be quarantined and the developer given the opportunity to fix any issues. Any earnings from that experience at the time of quarantine still in escrow will be refunded to buyers.
