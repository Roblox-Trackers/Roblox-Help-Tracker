      Passes, like VIP shirts, give players special perks and abilities in experiences. These added abilities can be anything, from super strength or speed, to a special itemâ€”

      Robux earned from Passes are placed in a
      <em>
       pending
      </em>
      status for up to seven days before being paid to the account. This pending status is called escrow. You can check your
      <strong>
       pending sales
      </strong>
      by viewing your
