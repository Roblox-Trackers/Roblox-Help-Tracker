      When looking through the Catalog or someone's Inventory, you can view more details about a specific item by tapping on it. The item's detail page will load with more information about it and a purchase option, if it's on sale. An example of a detail page:

      Basic Item Information

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Details on an item's page are broken down into the following:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Item Name
       </strong>
       - This is found to the right of the item picture
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Type
       </strong>
       - Let's you know if it's a gear, hat, decal, etc. If you found the item through a search and not by searching categories, please make sure the item category matches the type that you want to get before buying.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Description
       </strong>
       - Found below the item's Attributes. This will tell you a little about the item and, if it is a gear, will explain how to use some of its special abilities. If the description is too long to fit into the default amount of space, you'll see a
       <strong>
        More
       </strong>
       button that you can click to display the full text.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Genre
       </strong>
       - Found under Type. If the item is a gear, then this information will help you determine which games it is able to be used in.

      Under the title and category, you will see a picture of what the item looks like. In the lower right hand corner of the image, you'll see a 2D or 3D button. You click the button to change how the item is displayed. While the 3D model will spin by default, there are a couple of things that you can do to control it:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Click and drag the model to rotate it
      </li>

      Item Cost and Purchasing

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      To the right of the item's price, you will see a green
      <strong>
       Buy
      </strong>
      button. If you currently have enough Robux for the purchase (your balance will appear in the upper right corner of the screen), you can click that
      <strong>
       Buy
      </strong>
      button to purchase it. If this button is faded and not clickable, then the item is not able for purchase.
     </p>
     <h2 class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      What if it's a Limited or Limited U?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent3">
      If that is the case, then this box will contain slightly different information. These items are only sold for a limited period of time after which members are able to sell their own copies. As a result, the price listed will be the lowest price the item is currently being sold for. Clicking the
      <strong>
       Buy
      </strong>
      button will buy the item at the displayed cost.

      <em>
       Note: Be sure to look at the confirmation screen carefully before completing your transaction. Once a purchase has been confirmed, refunds will

       be able to be issued.

      and being sold by members, the Price Chart and Resellers' information will be displayed on the page.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent3">
      The Resellers section displays the list of users who are currently selling the item and the price in order from lowest to highest, which usually looks like this:
