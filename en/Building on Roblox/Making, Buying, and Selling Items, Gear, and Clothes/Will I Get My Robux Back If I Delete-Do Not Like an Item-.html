       Many items in the Catalog let you try them on your avatar before spending your hard-earned Robux. To use the

         clicking here

        Simply click
        <strong>

      This means that once you've found the item you're looking for, you can quickly put it on for free to see how great you'd look while you're battling hordes of zombies, racking up loads of money in a sim experience, or just hanging out with friends on your next Roblox adventure.

      Accidental Purchases

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      As a helpful feature to prevent accidental purchases, Roblox includes a pop-up window, asking you to confirm your selection before completing a transaction. Please be sure to slow down and read everything before hitting the confirm button. We know how exciting it can be to get something new but it is always important to check and make sure that this particular item is what you really want.
