     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Make as many badges and achievements you can for your place, and make sure the top ones are difficult, or nearly impossible, to earn. A lot of Roblox users are hard-core gamers, and they don’t think they've beaten the game until every achievement is completed and every trophy is obtained. Make ‘em work for it. You can also incentivize repeat visits by utilizing our

     <h2>
      Advertise Your Game
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Advertising your game on Roblox is a great way to get noticed and an awesome creative outlet. Roblox's two ad systems, User Ads and Sponsored games, are  fantastic ways to get your game seen by people that might otherwise have missed it. There are a limited number of ad slots, so they work on a bidding system—the more Robux you choose to spend on your promotion, the more frequently it’ll pop up on Roblox.com while users are browsing. But bidding is only half of the art—make creative, colorful ads that will draw people’s attention. For a more in-depth look on these systems, please see the following links:
