      As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure community safety, all games on the Roblox platform are now set to Non-Experimental Mode, and all future games will be created in Non-Experimental Mode by default.
     </p>
     <p>
      Creating an appropriate and safe environment for the entire community to enjoy is a top priority for Roblox.

      Games set to Non-Experimental Mode remove the potential ability
      <strike>
      </strike>
      (in Experimental Mode) for others to add additional content that the developer did not intend to be included in the game. For these reasons, Experimental Mode has been entirely discontinued.  In addition, the industry standard in game design is to have the server be the authority on the game state. By turning off Experimental Mode, we are aligned with industry standards.

     <p>
      Roblox will provide the support and resources that are needed to encourage the development of new games that are built with the proper controls in place to ensure the safest, most positive experience for our community.
