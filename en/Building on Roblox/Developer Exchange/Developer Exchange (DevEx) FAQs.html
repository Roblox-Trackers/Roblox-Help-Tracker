        What is the Developer Exchange (DevEx) program?
        <p>
         The Developer Exchange Program (also known as DevEx) allows you to earn money by creating awesome games on Roblox. The DevEx program is based on the services that you provide on the Roblox platform.

        What are the requirements?

         *Note All DevEx requests are reviewed for eligibility upon submission.

        How do I submit a DevEx request for review?
        <br/>
        <p>
         Follow these steps to get to the Developer Exchange Cashout Page:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Login to your Roblox account
         </li>
         <li>
          Select

        <br/>
        <p>
         Once you meet the basic requirements (Roblox Premium, minimum of 100k in your account, 13 years of age or older, etc) you will be able to see the Cash Out button on your account.

        <p>
         To initiate a Cash Out request, click the "Cash Out" button (as shown above) and enter all requested information (i.e. full name and email address along with other information as shown below).  Once done, select from the available payout (exchange rate) options, signify your continued agreement to the Terms and Conditions by clicking the associated check-box, and again click the "Cash Out" button. We will then review the request.

        <p>
         Please note, we do require that the Roblox account owner is the one who submits and completes the DevEx request. Please do not complete your DevEx request with the information of someone other than the account holder.

         I am a first-time user, what happens after submitting a DevEx request?
        </p>
        <p>
         After your DevEx request has been submitted, your DevEx request will be reviewed by the DevEx team. Please allow around 2 weeks for your request to be reviewed and processed. If your account is approved to proceed to the next step of processing you will be sent an invitation to the DevEx portal.
        </p>

         What should I do if I am under 18 years old and would like to participate in the DevEx program?
        </p>
        <p>
         If you are interested in participating in the DevEx program but you are under 18 years old, you can ask your parent to make a DevEx request on your behalf. If your account is approved to proceed to the next step, you and your parent will be sent an email to complete an ID verification from
         <a href="mailto:DevEx@roblox.zendesk.com">
          DevEx@roblox.zendesk.com
         </a>
         . Once we have validated your information, you will be sent an invitation to register for the DevEx portal.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        Can you let me know if I am eligible for DevEx before I submit a request?
        <p>
         Unfortunately, we are unable to pre-guarantee eligibility as all DevEx requests are reviewed upon submission. We do require that DevEx participants follow the Terms of Use and earn the Robux legitimately.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        How often can I cash out?
        <p>
         DevEx participants can have an approved DevEx request once a calendar month.

        <p>
         Once my DevEx request is cancelled will the Robux be returned to my Roblox account?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Yes, once your DevEx request has been cancelled the Robux will return immediately back to your Roblox account.

Suspicious activity or inaccuracies in the information submitted on your DevEx request and/or Tipalti portal can result in processing delays or can result in your DevEx request being declined.

          This is not a bug. If this affects you, your DevEx status on your Roblox account should be corrected within 3 business days. If your DevEx status is still pending after this time, please send an email to

         What causes DevEx requests to be declined
         <p>
          DevEx requests can be declined for multiple reasons. Common DevEx rejection reasons are detailed below:
         </p>
         <ul class="dev-bul">
          <li>
           Failure to complete registration/submit tax forms on the DevEx portal
          </li>
          <li>
           Insufficient Earned Robux (Please review section 3.b of the DevEx Terms of Use)
          </li>
          <li>
           Terms of Use violations including but not limited to
           <ol class="letter-paren">
            <li>
             Scamming
            </li>
            <li>
             Account Theft
            </li>
            <li>
             Attempting to exchange Robux for real currency other than through DevEx
            </li>
            <li>
             Other suspicious activity that is used to exploit other Roblox users or Roblox feature
            </li>
            <li>
             Any illegal or unethical activities
            </li>
           </ol>
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Please note that if your request is rejected for a Terms of Use violation then we will not be able to provide exact details on why you were rejected but only general information.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         My previous DevEx requests were approved, but my most recent DevEx request was declined. Why?
         <p>
          Approval of your previous DevEx request in no way is a guarantee that your future DevEx requests will be processed. All DevEx requests are reviewed for eligibility upon submission.
         </p>
         <p>
          If activity that violates the Terms of Use or the spirit of the program is identified at any time, Roblox reserves the right to decline the DevEx request.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         I received a moderation action on my account 3 years ago, does this mean I can’t DevEx?
         <p>
          Minor moderation infractions or having a moderation history does not necessarily mean that your account(s) are ineligible for DevEx. We do take into consideration the type of infraction and the timing of it during the review process.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are certain Terms of Use violations that are particularly egregious that can result in your DevEx request being declined regardless of the timing of the infraction.

         What is the DevEx/Tipalti portal?
         <p>
          Tipalti is a third-party payment processor that we have partnered with to process DevEx payments. Once you submit a DevEx request, and if it is approved to proceed to the next step you will be sent an invitation to the Tipalti portal. Portal invitations are sent to the email you provided on your DevEx request.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         When do I get my Tipalti portal?
         <p>
          If your account is approved to proceed to the next step of processing you will be sent an invitation to the DevEx portal. Once you submit a DevEx request for review, it can take around 5-7 days for you to receive the DevEx portal invitation.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         Am I sent an invitation each time I submit a DevEx request?
         <p>
          No. First time DevEx participants whose accounts have been approved to proceed to the next step of processing will be sent an invite to complete registration on the DevEx portal. Once you have completed registration you will not be asked to re-complete registration for future DevEx requests.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, it is your responsibility to ensure that the information you enter in the DevEx portal is accurate and kept up to date. The information you provide is used to ensure all payments comply with applicable laws and regulations. Inaccuracies in information provided could impact your payment.

          I don’t pay taxes; do I need to complete a tax form?

          Which tax form do I submit?
          <p>
           One of the steps in the DevEx payment process is supplying us with your tax-related information (requirements vary depending on the country in which you reside). Roblox recognizes these steps can be time-consuming and possibly tedious; however, these steps are mandated by the tax authorities in the countries in which Roblox operates.
          </p>

           Tax reporting requirements vary based on whether you are a U.S. person or non-U.S. person.

           According to the IRS, for U.S. federal tax purposes, a U.S. person includes, but is not limited to:

           All U.S. persons participating in the DevEx program are required to submit their W-9 tax form during their Tipalti account creation (after submitting their first payout request). Roblox will submit your tax information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to validate your tax ID information. If U.S. tax information does not exactly match IRS records, a Roblox DevEx agent will contact you to get further information through email. Please verify this information comes from

           If your cash earnings for the prior tax year are greater than $600 then Roblox will report your cash earnings to the IRS on IRS Form 1099-MISC.

The forms will be mailed to the address they provided on their W-9 and emailed to the email account associated with their Tipalti account

        <p>
         Why am I required to complete the ID verification?
        </p>
        <p>
         Roblox works hard to create a safe and fun environment for all of our community. In unison with that, we partnered with IDology to add an additional layer of protection for our Developers. The safety and security of our Developers is a top priority for our team.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reasons you may be asked to complete the ID verification:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Information changes and discrepancies
         </li>

         What forms of identification will I need to provide?

         Is IDology secure?
        </p>
        <p>
         The document and selfie that is provided and uploaded through IDology will be solely used for authentication. Your information will not be used for any other purposes. All of the information that is provided through the IDology link will be inaccessible after 14 days.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additionally, your data is encrypted at all times as it moves around the IDology network. The method HTTP over TLS 1.2 (https) is used when the data is in transit and then it is encrypted via AES 256 at the field level before it is sent to the inside for storage.

           <p>
            Group payouts are considered earned if the group funds are composed of bona fide sales of virtual items/clothing. Please note, we check all sales and group funds for validity. If you receive group funds from a group that earned the Robux fraudulently or against Roblox TOS, then those will not count towards your earned Robux balance.
