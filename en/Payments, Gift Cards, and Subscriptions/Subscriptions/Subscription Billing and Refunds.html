       Can I purchase a subscription that doesn’t automatically renew?
      </strong>
      <span style="color: #666666;">

     </h2>
     <p>
      No. All subscriptions offered by experiences will automatically renew until canceled.

      We want to offer you the option to subscribe to experiences within our mobile app, but also to reflect the higher costs associated with selling subscriptions within mobile platforms. You always have the option to subscribe at desktop prices on your mobile device by visiting the Store tab of the experience’s page in your mobile web browser or on desktop.

     <p>
      You can subscribe on the Roblox desktop app, or via a web browser with a saved credit or debit card. Subscriptions can be purchased on the Roblox app on Apple or Google devices via the payment methods available through your App Store account.

       How do I add a saved card to subscribe on desktop / web if I’m under 18?
      </strong>
     </h2>
     <p>
      Saving a payment method to your Roblox account requires parent permission. Attempting to subscribe via desktop / web will prompt your parent to approve saving payment methods to your Roblox account. If they do not already have an account with parent privileges, they will need to create one before approving your request.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payment methods can be added to your Roblox account for subscriptions once your parent has approved your request.

       How do I change my payment information associated with my subscription?
      </strong>
      <span style="color: #666666;">
      </span>
     </h2>
     <p>
      We do not support updating the payment method on active subscriptions. To update the payment information on your subscriptions, you will need to cancel and resubscribe with the new payment method after the subscription has expired.

       What happens if a subscription is taken off sale?
      </strong>
      <span style="color: #666666;">
      </span>
     </h2>
     <p>
      If a Creator decides to take a subscription off sale, you will enjoy your benefits until the end of the subscription period, at which point the subscription will expire and not renew.
     </p>
     <p>
      Creators also have the option to permanently delete a subscription. If this happens, you will no longer be able to access your benefits and will be issued a refund for the most recent subscription payment. Refunds may take 5-7 days to appear on your bank statement.
