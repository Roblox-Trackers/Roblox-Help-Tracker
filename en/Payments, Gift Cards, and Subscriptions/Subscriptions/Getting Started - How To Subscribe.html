       Which devices can I use to purchase a subscription offered by an experience?

     </h2>
     <p>
      Currently, subscriptions within experiences can be purchased via web browser, or via the Roblox app on desktop, Apple or Google devices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subscriptions are
      <strong>
       not currently available
      </strong>
      for purchase in app on Amazon, Windows, Xbox, Meta Quest or PlayStation devices.

       Where can I view subscriptions offered by experiences?

      <span style="color: #666666;">
      </span>
     </h2>
     <p>
      You can view subscriptions offered within the experience itself, or browse the experience’s page. In a web browser, these will be under the “Store” tab where passes are today. In the app, you can find subscriptions available for purchase in the “Passes &amp; Subscriptions” tab.

       Can I purchase a subscription if I am under 18?
      </strong>
      <span style="color: #666666;">
      </span>
     </h2>
     <p>
      Yes. You will need your parent’s permission to add a card for purchases on desktop or web, and will be subject to any parental controls applied via App Store settings on your mobile device.

       Can I subscribe across multiple accounts?
      </strong>
      <span style="color: #666666;">
      </span>
     </h2>
     <p>
      Yes, you will be able to subscribe across multiple accounts on desktop or web browser. For mobile app subscriptions purchased via Apple or Google, however, only one account can be associated with the Apple ID or Google account on the device at any time.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, if you have 2 Roblox accounts that you use on the same iPad (RobloxUser1 and RobloxUser2), and if you have an active subscription associated with RobloxUser1 that you are paying for via Apple, you will not be able to subscribe on RobloxUser2 via the Roblox iPad app. To subscribe on RobloxUser2, you must use the desktop app or a web browser on desktop or mobile to subscribe on that account.

     <p>
      No, you cannot be subscribed to the same subscription more than once at the same time on a single account. If your subscription has expired, you are free to subscribe to the same subscription again.
