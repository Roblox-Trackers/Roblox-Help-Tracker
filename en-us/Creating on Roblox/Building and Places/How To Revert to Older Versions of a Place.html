      Roblox retains copies of all uploaded places. This means that any time you make any changes to a place and publish them to Roblox, a copy without these changes is saved as a past version. You can find and revert to one of these older versions at any time.
      <span>
       Roblox automatically retains saved versions of each place for version control and backup purposes.
