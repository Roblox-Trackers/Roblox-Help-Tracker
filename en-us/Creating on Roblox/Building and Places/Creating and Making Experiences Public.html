      You may find that developing one experience just isn't enough to satisfy your craving for creativity. Luckily, we can help! All users are able to build as many experiences as they want, though accounts are limited to 200 public experiences (able to be played by others) at any given time. You can create a new experience at any time, but it cannot be enjoyed by other Roblox players until it is made public.
