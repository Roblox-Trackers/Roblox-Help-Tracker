      Unfortunately, sometimes players create packages or plugins that don't really do what is advertised or may even cause strange and undesired behavior.Â  These are known as infected, and are just regular packages or plugins that have bad scripts in them. They are usually made to cause problems for experience developers and be a nuisance.

      What if my place is already infected?

      While the removal of an infection can, at times, be difficult there are a few things to try.

      Revert to an older version

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      If your place is already uploaded to your account, you can go to the Version History section of its configuration page and reset the place to an earlier version. Be sure to pick a date that definitely did not experience the infection. This does mean that you'll need to rebuild/rescript everything that was added after this point, but it may be able to prevent you from having to rebuild everything. Do be careful when re-adding any free packages to prevent the infection from returning. For help with the process of reverting, please

      Sometimes the infection may go so deep that the only way to fix it is to start over again. For help with resetting to a basic template, please

      How do I prevent infections from occurring in the first place?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      To prevent your places from being infected in the future, there are several things that you can do:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Always save your progress before inserting free packages.
       </li>
       <li>
        Always investigate packages that you take out of the public inventory. Make sure it has no bad scripts in them, or scripts that have questionable names. If the package has comments enabled, read them to see what other players have said.
       </li>
       <li>
        Utilize Roblox Studio to its fullest for building experiences, as bad scripts in packages cannot be run in the Studio environment by default. You can then check packages and prevent bad things from occurring.
       </li>
       <li>
        For plugins - try running the plugin in a test place prior to putting it into your experience place.
       </li>
      </ul>
     </ul>

       Note: There is no way for the script to get into your account security or billing information, so don't worry. You can report these packages via our Report Abuse system by clicking on the Report Abuse link located on the package/script/plugin's description page, so that our moderators can remove them as soon as possible.
