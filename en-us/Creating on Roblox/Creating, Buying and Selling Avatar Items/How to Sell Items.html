      How to Resell Limited and Limited U Items
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Right now only an account with a membership can participate in reselling. Additionally, only items marked as Limited or Limited U are able to be resold. If an item is Limited or Limited U, there will be an icon declaring it as such underneath the item's picture when viewing its details page or when browsing the Marketplace.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      To sell an item that meets the above requirements, please follow the below steps:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Go to its details page
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       View the
       <strong>
        Owned Items
       </strong>
       section under the price chart
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       If you own multiple copies of the item, select which copy you want to sell
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Click
       <strong>
        Sell
       </strong>
       next to that item
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       Enter your desired price in the box that is displayed
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      <em>
       Note: Limited or Limited U items can only be resold by accounts with a Premium membership. After purchase, items enter a hold for up to 30 days. The item can only be resold after this holding period ends.
      </em>

      Pricing Your Sales
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Be careful when setting your sale price. If you set the wrong price and it sells (a low price can cause the item to sell almost immediately), Roblox will not be able to reverse the transaction.
