       How do I cancel a subscription?
      </strong>
     </h2>
     <ol>
      <li>
       Log into the account where the subscription was bought. You can do this from any device.
      </li>
      <li>
       Go to the Subscriptions tab in Settings [Link]
      </li>
      <li>
       Find the subscription you'd like to cancel and click the “&gt;” button to see subscription details.
      </li>
      <li>
       Select “Cancel Renewal” and follow the cancellation confirmation prompts.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      To avoid further charges, cancel your Subscription
      <strong>
       at least 24 hours
      </strong>
      before the auto-renewal period. You will continue to receive benefits from your subscription until the end of the billing cycle. Canceling does not result in a refund.

       Can I resubscribe after I have canceled my subscription?
      </strong>
      <span style="color: #666666;">
      </span>
     </h2>
     <p>
      Yes, you can resubscribe to previously canceled or expired subscriptions. Note - If you have canceled your subscription but it is still active (i.e., before the expiration date), you will not be able to reactivate your subscription.  You will need to wait for the subscription to fully expire.

       Are there upgrade or downgrade options available?

      <span style="color: #666666;">
      </span>
     </h2>
     <p>
      All subscriptions currently offered within experiences are not tiered, so there is no need to upgrade or downgrade.

       Can I still manage a mobile subscription directly from my App Store Subscription settings?
      </strong>
     </h2>
     <p>
      For users Turning off auto-renew on your iOS / Android devices’ app purchasing platform prevents billing for the next payment period, and also Unsubscribes you, but won’t refund your purchase. Similarly, when you purchase a Subscription to someone through our payment partner Stripe on twitter.com, choosing to Cancel your plan prevents billing for the next payment period, and also Unsubscribes you, but won’t refund your purchase.

      For people living in the EU or UK, please review additional cancellation instructions, related refund policies and model cancellation forms for the Apple App Store
