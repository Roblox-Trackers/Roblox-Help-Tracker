      Can I get free Robux, Memberships, or valuable items?
     </h1>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      No. Any offer of free Robux, memberships, or valuable items is a scam. These are meant to trickÂ you into giving out your password or personal information, or make you click on a bad link. Their goal is to take your account and all your Robux and items.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      There is no such thing as free Robux or membership offers, tricks, or codes. If a person, video, website, or game tries to tell you there is one, this is a scam and a violation of our

       Terms of Use
      </a>
      . If you follow their advice and make false claims of a purchase in order to get free Robux or memberships, this is also a violation of our rules and could result in your account being deleted.
