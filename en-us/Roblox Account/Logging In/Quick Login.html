      QR Code Troubleshooting
     </h2>
     <p>
      <span>
       If you see an option to log in with a QR code and you're having trouble, try these steps:
      </span>
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       Make sure you have the latest version of the Roblox app installed.
       <ol>
        <li>
         You also need another app to scan the QR code. Try your device's camera app or any QR code scanner of your choice!
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
       Make sure you’re logged into the device you’re scanning the QR code from.
      </li>
      <li>
       On some phones (e.g. Google Pixel), the built-in camera app might not handle the QR
       <br/>
       code properly. Try installing a different QR code scanner or logging in by entering the
       <br/>
       six-character code instead.

     </ol>
