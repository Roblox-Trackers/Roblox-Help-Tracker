       How is my account location determined?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Your account’s location is detected automatically based on various signals such as your IP address. If you are using a VPN connection or traveling, the accuracy of your location may be affected.

       What is my account location used for?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Your account location is used in multiple areas, including customizing your experience on Roblox. However, the main reason users may want to modify the location is to determine what currency is allowed to be used on the account for purchasing Robux and redeeming gift cards. For example, if you want to redeem a gift card, the currency for that gift card must match the currency for your account location.

       How do I change my account location?
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      If your account location is set incorrectly, you can update it one time on your own by going into Settings &gt; Account Info. Under the “Personal” section, choose the correct location from the drop down menu. If you’re not sure about why you need to change your location, do not modify it. Once you change the location, you will not be able to modify it on your own again.
