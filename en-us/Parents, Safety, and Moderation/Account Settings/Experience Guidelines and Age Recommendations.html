     <p>
      Roblox’s experience guidelines were created so all users can make informed decisions about the content they interact with. To determine the suitability of content for each age category, we examined global industry standards and consulted child development experts to guide our policy making.

      When viewing an experience you can see the recommended age guideline as well as descriptors about what kind of content exists with an experience
