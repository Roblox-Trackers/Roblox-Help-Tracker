       Q: How does Roblox know that the parental/guardian email address provided actually belongs to the parent?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: We trust our users to be honest about entering a parental/guardian email address. Parents/guardians can reset the parental/guardian email address on the account by accessing their child’s account.
     </p>

      <strong>
       Q: Is this feature available for under 13 users only?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: This feature is currently available for under 18 users in Korea and under 13 users elsewhere.

      <strong>
       Q: Will parents/guardians be notified when the monthly spending limit has been reached?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: No, parents/guardians will not get an email notification unless they elect to receive email notifications from Roblox on all spend activity (make sure to add your email to the user account under “Account Info” in settings).
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Q: Can parents/guardians set a daily or weekly spend limit?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: No, this setting limits the amount of spending permitted on the user's account per calendar month only.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Q: What will happen if the parent PIN is deleted?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: If the parent PIN is deleted after the account settings have been changed, the settings should revert to default.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Q: If the account doesn't have a parent PIN, but it has a verified parental/guardian email address, can users make any changes to the account settings?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A: If there is no parent PIN but there is a verified parental/guardian email address, attempting to change the settings will prompt the parent PIN to be added to the account.
