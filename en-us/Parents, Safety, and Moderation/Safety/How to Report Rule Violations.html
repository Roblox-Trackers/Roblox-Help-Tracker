      Roblox is a great community of players and developers of many ages, and we like to encourage a safe and fun environment for everyone. If you see other users breaking the rules, we have tools in place to help you report any inappropriate behavior.
     </p>

      For information about
      <strong>
       blocking
      </strong>
      another user from contacting or chatting, read the

      The Report Abuse feature is the best way to let us know about rule-breakers and bad content. It sends reports directly to our moderators and provide a way for us to keep track of repeat offenders so further steps can be taken against their account. When reporting abuse, be sure to report the specific Chat, Private Message, Experience or other Content that violates Roblox rules. If you just report a user from their profile page, our moderators won't be able to see what they did wrong.
