Gift Cards and Credits shall be collectively referred to herein as “Cards.” This Agreement is between you and Roblox Prepaid Company, LLC (“Issuer”).

            Cards are issued by Issuer. Issuer is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Card and the Card programs. Issuer is the sole legal obligor to you; provided, however, that Issuer may assign its obligations with respect to the Cards at any time, in which case such assignee shall become the Issuer and sole legal obligor. Roblox Corporation (“Roblox”) and its affiliates and related entities (other than Issuer) bear no responsibility or liability for any Cards, and you hereby knowingly release Roblox and its affiliates and related entities (other than Issuer) from any and all liability or claims of any nature whatsoever arising in connection with any Card.

            Gift Cards can be purchased at authorized retailers in the United Kingdom and distributors or online at
            <a href="https://www.roblox.com/giftcards" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
             https://www.roblox.com/giftcards
            </a>
            . Gift Cards are not valid and will not be honored if obtained from unauthorized sellers, resellers or distributors, including through Internet auction sites. Gift Cards are redeemable only for purchases of Credits at
            <a href="https://www.roblox.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
             https://www.roblox.com
            </a>
            . To redeem a Gift Card, you must be over 18 years old or obtain consent from a parent or guardian, have Internet access, login or register to create a Roblox account, and accept the then-current version of the Roblox Terms of Use or have your parent or guardian accept them if you are under 18 years old. The Terms of Use include User Terms, Creator Terms, a Privacy Policy and various other terms, which are subject to change from time to time, and are available at
            <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004647846" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

            </a>
            . You must also acknowledge and agree that the value stated on the face of your Gift Card will redeem for the value of Credits in your local currency. You can only redeem a Gift Card that is denominated in the same currency as the country where your account is registered. In other words, you cannot redeem a Gift Card, which is denominated in British pound sterling, to a Roblox account that is denominated in another currency, such as Euros. If you have moved and would like to change the denomination of your Roblox account to a different currency, please contact us at

            . Gift Cards are not debit or credit cards. Gift Cards have no cash value, are not refundable or reloadable and may not be redeemed for cash (except as required by law). Gift Cards cannot be resold. Gift Cards must be redeemed in full and cannot be partially redeemed.

          <div>
           <p>
            When you redeem a Gift Card, you will receive the equivalent amount of Credits in British pound sterling in your Roblox account. For example, a £100 Gift Card will be redeemed for £100 in Credits. Credits may be redeemed only for Robux (Roblox’s in-game currency issued by Roblox) or a Premium Subscription to Roblox. A Roblox Premium Subscription is a monthly subscription program where you receive a specified number of Robux per month, as well as certain other benefits, in exchange for a monthly fee. You can find more information about Roblox’s Premium Subscription at
            <a href="https://www.roblox.com/premium/membership" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
             https://www.roblox.com/premium/membership
            </a>
            . To redeem Credits, you must be over 18 years old or obtain consent from a parent or guardian. Availability and pricing of Robux and Premium Subscriptions are subject to change (current pricing information can be found at
            <a href="https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
             https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux
            </a>
            ). Credits have no cash value, are not refundable or transferable and may not be redeemed for cash (except as required by law). Note: Prior to April 24, 2023, Gift Cards denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars were redeemable for Credits denominated in U.S. Dollars. As of such date, all such Credits were converted from U.S. Dollars to the currency of your home country.

The selection of which virtual item and bonus item you will receive is entirely within the discretion of Issuer and its affiliates. Free virtual items and/or bonus items may be discontinued or replaced at any time.
