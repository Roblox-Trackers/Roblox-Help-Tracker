      You can contact the Appeals team to review the situation if any of your content has been blocked or deleted. Content is something you made such as experiences, decals, clothes, group logos, or audio files. Although most content cannot typically be restored once moderated, the Appeals team will do their best to find a satisfactory resolution.
