    Appeal Your Content or Account Moderation

     <p>
      You can contact the Roblox Appeals team to review the situation if your content or account has been banned or moderated, or any of your content has been blocked or deleted. The Appeals team will give the moderation a second look and make any necessary adjustments to your asset or account's moderation status. Submitting an appeal does not guarantee the consequence will be removed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Content is something you made such as experiences, decals, clothes, group logos, or audio files. Although most content cannot typically be restored once moderated, the Appeals team will do their best to find a satisfactory resolution.

The EU Commission will maintain a list of accredited out-of-court dispute settlement bodies for this purpose.
