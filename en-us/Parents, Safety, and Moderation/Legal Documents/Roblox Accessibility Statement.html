      We are committed to making our websites accessible to and usable by people with disabilities by meeting or exceeding the requirements of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 Level A/AA (WCAG 2.1 A/AA). Our goal is to help make Roblox a fun, safe, and equitable experience for all.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      As part of our commitment to accessibility, we actively monitor our websites and make sure that all content provided is accessible to all visitors. In order to help us in this process, we have engaged
      <a href="https://www.boia.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
       The Bureau of Internet Accessibility
      </a>
      , an accessibility consulting company, to conduct a full accessibility audit consisting of both automated and manual testing of our websites using BoIA’s A11Y® platform which provides us with specific recommendations that will assist us in ensuring that our Web presence is in conformance with the WCAG 2.1 A/AA.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Helping to ensure that Roblox remains equitable for everyone is an ongoing commitment, in that our work will evolve, improve, and change over time. It is important to note that efforts with respect to our websites are ongoing as we work to implement the relevant improvements to continually achieve and meet WCAG 2.1 A/AA guidelines.
