             To begin advertising services, eligible Advertisers may obtain ads using either a credit card or Ad Credit as follows:
             <ol type="i">
              <li>
               Advertisers who are over 13 years of age but less than 18 years of age may obtain Ads using Ad Credit only.
              </li>
              <li>
               Advertisers who are over 18 years of age may obtain Ads by either using Ad Credit or paying via credit card.
              </li>
              <li>
               To purchase Ads using a credit card, Advertiser will provide a valid credit card on file and will be charged incrementally as they incur advertising services. At the conclusion of the Advertiser’s monthly billing cycle, Roblox will charge the Advertiser’s credit card for any advertising services not yet charged to the Advertiser.
              </li>
              <li>
               To obtain Ads using Ad Credit, Advertiser will use Robux to acquire a minimum of ten (10) Ad Credit in Ads Manager. Ad Credit may only be acquired using Robux and may only be used to obtain Ads from within the Roblox Ads Manager. Ad Credits obtained are final and non-refundable, and Ad Credit may not be converted back to Robux once acquired. Ad Credit is not a substitute for real currency, does not earn interest, and has no equivalent value in real currency. Ad Credit is immediately debited from an Advertiser’s Ad Credit balance when it is used to purchase Ads; any Ad Credit balance that has not yet been used to purchase Ads will be displayed in Advertiser’s Payment Settings in Ads Manager.
              </li>
              <li>
               Users who are under 13 years of age may not purchase Ads or Ad Credit.

Where taxes are chargeable, Roblox reserves the right to charge these to the Advertiser and will provide the required invoice or supporting documentation. Advertiser shall be responsible for all such charges, costs, and taxes, except for any taxes imposed on, or related to, Roblox's income, revenues, gross receipts, personnel, real or personal property, or other assets.

            <li>
             For Ads designed to appear within Developer Experiences, Advertiser is not able to select or specify any particular Developer Experience in which the Ads are to appear, and Roblox does not guarantee the appearance of Ads on any particular platform or in any particular Developer Experience. Ads may appear in the Experiences of any Developer participating in the Ad Network.
            </li>
            <li>
             Roblox will make reporting available to Advertiser throughout the campaign and such reports will include the aggregate number of estimated impressions delivered. Roblox will attempt but does not guarantee even distribution of impressions over the course of the campaign. Such reporting, as provided by Roblox, shall be sole means of tracking and reporting delivery for the campaign and shall be the controlling measurement for purposes of measuring delivery.

            <li>
             Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the parties understand, acknowledge, and agree that Roblox will not make available or provide to Advertiser, and Advertiser will not provide, collect, process, or make available to Roblox, any data that constitutes “personal data” or “personal information” as such terms are normally defined under applicable law (including, for example, the California Privacy Rights Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act and similar laws). Advertiser will only have access to certain aggregate reporting and metrics about the performance of its campaign (e.g., number of impressions). Accordingly, these Ad Terms are not intended to cover the processing of such personal information and the Parties agree that additional terms will be required in the event of such processing.

             Advertiser understands and acknowledges that the Experiences and other content on the Platform primarily consists of UGC. Roblox makes no representations or warranties in connection with such content, and Roblox cannot guarantee that Ads will not appear alongside content that violates the Roblox TOU, violates applicable laws, or is otherwise inappropriate. In the event Advertiser’s Ads appear against any such content, Advertiser may notify Roblox and Roblox will take commercially reasonable steps to facilitate the removal of such content. The foregoing shall be Advertiser’s sole remedy regarding the content contained on the Platform and in the Experiences against which the Ads appear and Roblox shall have no other obligations, responsibility, or liability in connection with such content.
            </li>
            <li>
             Roblox reserves the right within its discretion to reject or remove from its Platform any Ads which do not comply with the Roblox TOU, or that in Roblox’s sole reasonable judgment, do not comply with any applicable law, regulation, or other judicial or administrative order. In addition, Roblox reserves the right within its discretion to reject or remove from its Platform any Ads which may tend to bring, disparagement, ridicule, or scorn upon Roblox.
            </li>
            <li>
             Roblox may remove the Advertiser and restrict access to Roblox Platform and Ad Network at any time if Advertiser is in material breach of its obligations hereunder.

            <li>
             Except as required by law, all Ads purchased with credit card or obtained with Ad Credit are final and non-refundable in Robux or cash.
