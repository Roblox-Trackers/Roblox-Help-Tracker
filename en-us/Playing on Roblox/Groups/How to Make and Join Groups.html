     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      To locate a group:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       Click on the
       <strong>
        Search

       Choose to search in groups
      </li>
     </ol>

      Once a group has been selected, go to that group's page, and click the
      <strong>
       Join Group

      button. If joining the group requires manual approve, wait until the request to join is approved. Depending on the group, the owner may have specific requirements such as sending a Personal Message before a request to join the group is approved.

     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      <strong>
       Answer:
      </strong>
      Currently, there is no way to delete a group. Make sure the name is right
