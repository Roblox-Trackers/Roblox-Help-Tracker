      What is Roblox Connect?
     </h3>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Connect is an experience on Roblox where you can call a friend and have a conversation as your avatars—together in a shared immersive space. We’ve created some fun location options for you and your friends to enjoy. In addition, the technology that powers Connect is fully open-sourced to empower creators to build synchronous voice and avatar communication into any existing or new experience on Roblox.

      How Does Roblox Connect Work for Creators?

     </p>
     <h3 class="wysiwyg-indent1" id="h_01HF50BXGEC82553M2Z61T67Y7">
      How can creators incorporate the APIs in their experiences?
     </h3>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      The Roblox Connect experience will be fully-open sourced, along with the calling APIs, that developers can enable to bring synchronous avatar communication into any experience on Roblox. There are three ways that developers can utilize the technology:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent2">
       Incorporate communication within their experiences using the new calling APIs:
       <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SocialService">
        SocialService
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/PlayerViewService">
        PlayerView
       </a>
       . Creators will be able to integrate the phone book functionality and UX into their experience, enabling users to easily call their friends from any experience.
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent2">
       Enable communication-first features, like
       <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SocialService">
        SelfView
       </a>
       , so users in experiences can see themselves in first person. In addition, there are three views that the calling APIs will enable:
       <ul>
        <li class="wysiwyg-indent2">
         <strong>
          <span class="wysiwyg-underline">
           PIP (Picture-in-Picture)
          </span>
         </strong>
         : When a user opens up Connect through a call or being called, we pop up the SelfView on your first time landing in PIP mode. The SelfView will appear in the bottom left corner. Once the user moves it, it will stick to that position from then on.
        </li>
        <li class="wysiwyg-indent2">
         <strong>
          <span class="wysiwyg-underline">
           Free Play
          </span>
         </strong>
         : Free Play is Roblox's stock default camera, third person view, that comes with every experience.
        </li>
        <li class="wysiwyg-indent2">
         <strong>
          <span class="wysiwyg-underline">
           Cinematic
          </span>
         </strong>
         : Cinematic Mode provides a dynamic camera. It adjusts the camera's position, direction, and field of view in real-time, focusing on two in-game subjects. It also accounts for factors like distance between subjects and screen aspect ratio, delivering a smooth and responsive player experience.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent2">
       Take advantage of Roblox Connect’s environmental assets. Using the Environment Switcher, users will be able to access several locations during their calls in either a forest (at a campfire, dock, waterfall) or at an island (at a beach, cabana, or bonfire) and can teleport to these new locations during their call.

      No, adding calling into an experience doesn’t change its Experience Guidelines, but only eligible users within that experience (13+, phone or ID verified) will be able to use the calling features.
