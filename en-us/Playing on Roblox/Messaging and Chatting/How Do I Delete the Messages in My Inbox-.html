      The Archive action will move messages from your inbox to your Archive tab. To archive a message, while viewing it, simply click the
      <strong>
       Archive
      </strong>
      button located below the navigation tabs.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent2">
      <em>
       Note: You can move messages back to your inbox later by finding them in the Archive tab, viewing it, and clicking the
       <strong>
        Move to Inbox
       </strong>
       button.
