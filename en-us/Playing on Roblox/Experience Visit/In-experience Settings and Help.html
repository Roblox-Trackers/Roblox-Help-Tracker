      As long as the experience developer hasn't locked the camera mode to something specific, you can switch between Classic and Follow.

      <li>
       In
       <strong>
        Classic mode
       </strong>
       , the camera remains fixed in one spot unless it is manually adjusted. To change your avatar's vantage point, hold down the right button on your mouse and drag it around.
      </li>
      <li>
       In
       <strong>
        Follow mode
       </strong>
       , the camera will rotate with your avatar as you move right or left to help keep your intended targets in view.
       <ul>
        <li>
         Shift Lock Switch enables you to toggle between camera modes by pressing the Shift key on your keyboard.

      We currently provide three accessibility settings to better tailor your experience on Roblox.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       <strong>
        Reduce Motion
       </strong>
       disables or reduces certain screen effects within the app and within an experience. For example, instead of sliding the in-game menu onto your screen when it’s opened, it will fade in when Reduce Motion is enabled.
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       <strong>
        Background Transparency
       </strong>
       improves contrast and legibility by making backgrounds on UI elements more opaque, such as the chat window background. This will not make UI elements more transparent than what it normally is.
      </li>
      <li class="wysiwyg-indent1">
       <strong>
        UI Navigation Toggle
       </strong>
       controls whether or not you can use the \ key to enter and exit UI navigation mode. You can disable this setting if you’re accidentally entering UI navigation mode often, or if you don’t want to use the UI navigation mode functionality.
      </li>
