      What are screenshots on Roblox?
     </h2>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      A screenshot is a way to capture and save a snapshot of what is displayed on your device screen within an experience. When you take a screenshot, we remove the in-experience UI and add the experience name, creator, your name, and Roblox logo.
     </p>
     <p class="wysiwyg-indent1">
      Screenshots are available for all users and supported on mobile devices. Users can toggle this feature on or off at any time from their in-experience menu.
